0,484315,GlobalProtect Discussions,Adrian_Jensen,L4 Transporter,Windows11 fails to connect to Portal with client certificate authentication enabled,"I finally got combined certificate and user/pass/MFA authorization for our always-on VPN clients to multiple firewalls (cert auth to the Portal for valid asset checks and auto-login to trigger internal host detection, user/pass/MFA auth to the Gateway for actually establishing the VPN). Moved ~225 Windows10 clients in 1 swoop with only 1 problem (a missing cert on one machine). Has been pretty much trouble free except.... I have 2 Windows11 clients, neither of which can connect to the cert-authenticated Portals. Both can connect to a user/pass authenticated Portal without issue. The Windows11 GP clients show a ""The network connection is unreachable or the portal is unresponsive."" error message when connecting. Browsing to the portal address results in a ""Valid client certificate is required."" error message. The user cert requested for authentication is valid. Weirdly, the Windows11 GP client can connect to the exact same external Portal from inside the corporate network, with the cert, without issue (and trigger the internal host detection). Windows10 GP clients can connect internally and externally without issue. Has anyone seen this? Am I missing an option required for Windows11?",0,"

5,508579,GlobalProtect Discussions,sirons,L0 Member,Global Protect SAML Okta groups integration,I'm currently working on setting up our 2 PAs for VPN. I'm trying to get the configuration set up to do something similar to what we had on Cisco but with PA and SAML instead of LDAP. I've followed this doc https://saml-doc.okta.com/SAML_Docs/How-to-Configure-SAML-2.0-for-Palo-Alto-Networks-GlobalProtect.h... but in section 8 it doesn't exactly specify how to do that. I have 2 groups called vpn_level_1 and vpn_level_2. These groups would differentiate between which Client IP subnet as they'd reach different resources in the on prem network. Example 10.0.1.0/24 would be for vpn_level_1 and 10.0.2.0/24 would be for vpn_level_2. Our Okta instance sync's our AD groups and I'm trying not to do LDAP with this if at all possible. I also couldn't find a feature in the Gateway > Agent > Client Settings where IP Addressing would be on a specific group condition. I couldn't find this specific situation in the forums so any help would be appreciated.,0,"

The login method configured on GP is Pre-Logon method and we also had enabled ""No Direct Access to local network"". The Authentication method used is LDAP. Gateway is configured in Full tunnel mode As the user were working from home previously they will be able to access internet only when GP VPN is enabled. Now the users started moving to office and also in office environment they need to connect through GP to access internal network and internet. Is there any way to configure GP in such an manner that when the user is using his laptop in home he need to connect to GP-VPN to use their system and when they come to office no need to connect to GP-VPN to use their system to access internet and organization internal network. Thanks in advance!!   ",0,"

10,458548,GlobalProtect Discussions,IanBroadway,L2 Linker,Global Protect Transparent Update,"Hi All, I've been testing a transparent upgrade from 5.1.8 to 5.2.9. (only handful of clients) We're a windows 10 site, 1909 + So far so good however I have come across a client that refuses to update. the device prompted the update and informed the user of the process, client restarted and reconnected but stayed on 5.1.8. Looking at the PanGPS log I can see this just after upgrade start (T10172)Info ( 501): 01/12/22 13:19:33:320 msgtype = software-upgrade(T10172)Info ( 608): 01/12/22 13:19:33:320 #### updater started, command is C:\Users\********\AppData\Local\Temp\_temp20292.msi(T10172)Debug( 39): 01/12/22 13:19:33:320 try verify file C:\Users\********\AppData\Local\Temp\_temp20292.msi(T10172)Error( 165): 01/12/22 13:19:33:391 The file C:\Users\********\AppData\Local\Temp\_temp20292.msi is not signed or corrupted(T10172)Error( 638): 01/12/22 13:19:33:391 file did not signed by us, return now In the short term this is ok as its reverted and allowed the older version 5.1.8. to continue to work but I'd like to understand the exact issue/cause. I don't want to roll out to 1500 clients and find half don't want to update even if they do continue to work on the older version. I have found an article here https://knowledgebase.paloaltonetworks.com/KCSArticleDetail?id=kA14u000000HBW9CAO&lang=en_US%E2%80%A...that specifies a dns related issue but I know the portal fqdn is purely one IP address. There is no different internal address.That article explains multiple reasons for this error but I can't find proof of any other reasons? One thing I'm also concerned with is the client hasn't tried to upgrade again since? the portal app config specifies a config refresh interval of 1 hour so I would've hoped it would try updating again?  What other reasons would cause this behaviour and why isn't it trying to update the client on reconnect? ThanksIan",0,"

23,322868,GlobalProtect Discussions,jkoelker,L0 Member,Ping scan returning what looks like a PANGP MAC address,"Hi - we're all working remotely now - so I've connected GlobalProtect to reach resources on our domain. I was a little confused when I ran a ping scan on a particular subnet and all the devices returned the same MAC address along with the IP address, 02:50:41:00:00:02. I did a bit of research and learned that the GlobalProtect virtual ethernet adapter has the MAC 02:50:41:00:00:01, so I thought I was getting a little understanding of what I'm seeing - but I guess I didn't expect this behavior, to see all devices returning the same MAC that's just one digit different than my PANGP adapter. It happened with devices on two different subnets. Should I expect that this is what I'll always get when I do ping scans over the VPN? I can get the info I'm looking for by looking at the ARP cache on the various switches, but was curious about this.... Thanks.",0,"

25,506605,GlobalProtect Discussions,teSiemsen,L0 Member,GlobalProtect problem on Mac when menu bar icon is hidden,"I just upgraded from an older MacBook Pro to a newer one. The new MacBook has a smaller menu bar, due to a built-in camera that is housed in a ""display notch"", which hides part of the menu bar. See https://www.macrumors.com/how-to/hide-notch-macbook-pro/The menu bar displays fewer icons, so some icons are simply ""hidden"". For apps like GlobalProtect, this is a *big* problem. Without access to the GlobalProtect icon, the user has no way to make GlobalProtect do a ""connect"" or ""disconnect"". One work-around for this is to make sure you move the GlobalProtect icon over to the left side of the menu bar, so that it is always visible even on small displays. Otherwise, you won't be able to use GlobalProtect. Other choices involve installing third-party apps to handle the menu bar more flexibly.",0,"

There are a number of issues.- To start with, I can't seem to get the GlobalProtect icon from the login screen after several tries.- Then, even when I log in to the device and try to connect to GlobalProtect, I get prompted for keychain access so that GlobalProtect can access the machine certificate. I've seen the document that explains how to give GlobalProtect access to keychain so that I don't get this prompt. Even after making those changes, GlobalProtect doesn't attempt to connect from the login screen. It only attempts to connect when I've logged in to the device.- Another thing I've noticed is, when I look at the GlobalProtect logs for the Mac, I actually see the 'Auth Method' as 'Certificate'. BUT, the source user is the device name (which is defined in the certificate) rather than the 'pre-logon' user which I would expect for pre-logon, before the actual source user.- GlobalProtect version is 5.2.10.

I have tried making a local group that matches the ""role"" value, but that does not work. Has anyone done this, or have any insight on this? Regards, Mark",0,"

57,502598,GlobalProtect Discussions,JakeHarris,L1 Bithead,Odd Internal Host Behavior,"Community, First off, I'm looking for ideas on what could possibly be causing a situation we are experiencing.  This is an issue with Always On Mode, using SAML authentication (built in browser, no default browser), in an Internal Host Detection state.  We are not having any issues with a remote user at all, only when the user moves from remote to an office. Global Protect works well normally for internal host detection (no internal gateways).  We have a full FQDN DNS recursive lookup configured that works well.  However on occasion we will experience a user (usually 1-3 per week) that come into the office (after working on Always on VPN for several days) and can not connect to our internal network.  GP gives a connection error and because of traffic policy enforcement they can not connect to anything.  3 things are occurring at the point.  1. Client CAN nslookup the FQDN used for internal host detection, again this works from a command prompt, 2) Client can not communicate on the network, 3) Global Protect does not attempt internal host detection again. The fix has been to move the client to a public guest network, restart the PAN GPS service and connect the user to the Portal/Gateway.  Once this is done, we switch the user back to the production internal network, internal host detection is working again.  Note: simply rebooting the laptop does not fix it, restarting PAN GPS service alone does not fix it. We have clients running 5.2.9 and 5.2.12 that are experiencing this issue (Yes I have a ticket open, but not seeing much progress).  We were asked to set the user saving option in our portal config from ""Save Username Only"" to ""No"".  After doing this, almost every client in this test group began experiencing this issue, and several now experience the issue on every reboot or refresh connection.   Any help would be appreciated! Looking through pangps.log we see a few errors, which ends up in turning on the enforcer, without a network discovery:(P17196-T12160)Error( 480): 06/09/22 14:46:41:944 CPanHTTPSession::PostRequest: WinHttpReceiveResponse failed with error code 12152.(P17196-T12160)Debug(1182): 06/09/22 14:46:41:944 PostRequest error code=12152(The server returned an invalid or unrecognized response)(P17196-T12160)Debug(7301): 06/09/22 14:46:41:944 prelogin to portal result is (null)(P17196-T12160)Debug(7603): 06/09/22 14:46:41:944 Failed to pre-login to the portal vpn.mycorp.com with return value 12152(The server returned an invalid or unrecognized response).(P17196-T12160)Debug(8461): 06/09/22 14:46:41:944 Failed to get portal config from portal vpn.mycorp.com.(P17196-T12160)Debug(8503): 06/09/22 14:46:41:944 Try to restore last portal config from file.(P17196-T12160)Debug(8554): 06/09/22 14:46:41:944 Skip retrieve cached portal configuration for empty user(P17196-T12160)Debug(8481): 06/09/22 14:46:41:944 portal status is Invalid portal.(P17196-T12160)Debug(7095): 06/09/22 14:46:41:944 --Set state to Disconnected(P17196-T7972)Debug(2530): 06/09/22 14:46:41:944 Setting debug level to 5(P17196-T12160)Debug(1927): 06/09/22 14:46:41:944 unknown network type.(P17196-T12160)Debug(1898): 06/09/22 14:46:41:960 Send response to client for request portal(P17196-T7660)Debug( 845): 06/09/22 14:47:01:278 enforcer exception: call SPSetParameters to set 2 IPs ",0,"

When moving to BigSur, we have to upgrade Crowdstrike into v6, but GlobalProtect is not seeing it as part of the HIP reports.We've been able to ""fool"" GlobalProtect by inserting plist files from Crowdstrike in /Library/LaunchDaemons but this is not making GlobalProtect detect Crowdstrike.Is there still compatibility updates that need to be done in GlobalProtect to recognise Crowdstrike v6?",0,"

On the Window servers and some of the more sensitive mobile devices (Windows laptops) we are installing the RSA SecurID Windows MFA Agent. The RSA MFA works fine if GlobalProtect is not installed on my test laptop. If GlobalProtect is installed the MFA challenge fails to be presented on login or unlocking a session. When I look at the login options on the Windows Hello prompt for logging in, GlobalProtect is presented first, then RSA Windows MFA Agent. MFA does work when bringing up the VPN or hitting the VPN portal with the browser.  I don't believe it is a DNS or routing issue, the problem still presents itself when the laptop is on the physical network and VPN is not being used. It might  simply be a sequencing issue with GP getting in the way some how.  Any ideas on solutions, causes, or settings I need to change?  Googling and searching the knowledge bases here and at RSA have yielded nothing.  -Freeman Pascal, Rhinocorps, Ltd CO. ",0,"

In the past end users where told to go to Portal A, or B, and switch to another if they had problems. Now with auto-selection of Gateway, regardless of which Portal they connect to, I find people are selecting a preferred Gateway out of habit, or because they were told to in the past, or because they think one will be ""faster"", instead of leaving it on ""Best Available"" to float between available Gateways. I can turn off ""manual"" and remove the end user option to select a different Gateway, but I'd like to retain that in case I need an end user to test/switch to a particular Gateway. Is there another way to reset the end user's preferred Gateway automatically?",0,"

I can parse pan_gp_event.log, but that seems somewhat crude. I noticed that GPA queries the service (PanGPS) from its log:...which returns a detailed status report in XML format!  Is there any way to get the same info myself? Or any other suggestions for the most reliable way to get live uptime info? Alternately, any other approach of triggering an event x minutes before GP timeout? Your help is greatly appreciated.

During the autopilot process I am deploying GlobalProtect during the device setup with a command line like this:/quiet PORTAL=""devicevpn.mydom.com"" ShowPrelogonButton=""yes"" CONNECTMETHOD=”pre-logon"" PRELOGON=""1"" I'm also issuing a device cert through our SCEP portal in Azure during this device setup process.  I have also tried running a PowerShell script at this time to enable plap, but it has no effect on the outcome. Once device setup completes, it prompts the user to login so that it can finish the ""User Setup"" process.In the Network sign-in area on login, you can see the GlobalProtect Status is ""NotPrelogon"", even though this is clearly a logon screen. I've been working on this for over a month now, and I can't get this working. I'm seriously thinking about doing a windows VPN...Has anyone gotten this working? I've started tickets with support, but it's so hard to communicate... The certificates seem to work once a user has successfully logged in one time, but that doesn't help since this is supposed to be prelogon. The users will be at home, with no access to Active Directory without VPN. Thanks, Kevin  ",0,"

134,481716,GlobalProtect Discussions,Adrian_Jensen,L4 Transporter,"GlobalProtect Portal authentication by certificate fails with ""Valid client certificate is required""","I have been trying for some time to get a mutli-stage GP login working in an always-on VPN. Going from an existing user/pass login to both the Portal and Gateway (with third party MFA over radius, cookies to prevent dual auth request), to a certificate login to the Portal (for automatic login/updates of GP client configs and immediate internal host detection) and user/pass on the Gateway. It seems that when the Portal and Gateway are on the same IP, the Gateway SSL/TLS Profile and Client Authentication settings override the Portal configuration settings. Can anyone confirm this? I can't find it documented anywhere. Example config:GP -> Portals -> [VPN_ISP1_Portal] -> Authentication:        SSL/TLS Profile = [PublicCert_1]        Client authentication = Certificate Profile -> [VPN_Client_Certs]GP -> Gateways -> [VPN_ISP1_Gateway] -> Authentication:        SSL/TLS Profile = [PublicCert_2]        Client authentication = user/pass profile Browse to the Portal/Gateway IP (or try to connect with GP client) and get a page with ""Valid client certificate is required"" error, page is signed with PublicCert_2. If you delete the Gateway (or presumably move it to to a different IP - not tested yet), the you get a successful certificate authentication against the Portal and the webpage is signed by PublicCert_1.",0,"

However, we want to set up a second portal/gateway for our admins to use, separate from our users. My problems stems from where to begin? After some research I did find that it's possible to have multiple portals/gateways on a single PA, though I believe we only need 1 and some access rules. We want to be able to allow access to our server subnet from the admin VPN, and not from the user VPN. I would appreciate any assistance regarding this",0,"

Our GP clients are configured for User-Login (Always On) and connected from home or the corporate general Wifi (different SSID). I have setup the Internal Host Detection, PC can connect to the new Wifi just fine and query the DNS records without issue - rDNS name matches Hostname. The first time a PC connects to the new Wifi the GP client detects it is on the internal network and allows connection as expected. After logging out/switching to a different network that requires VPN connection, and then switching back, the GP client will no longer detect it is on the internal network again. Looking in the PanGPS.log, there are DNSQuery = 9003 errors when off network (as expected). When on the new Wifi there are no DNSQuery entries in the logs and no indication the GP client is attempting to do rDNS. Things looked at/fixed already but didn't change behavior:",0,"

The WAN set up is a dual ISP connection to a single ISP which are configured using BGP. I was adding a new Global Protect Gateway and portal that is segregated from the existing one to connect separate group of users. Separate domain name and public IP with standalone SSL Certificate created for each on LetsEncrypt. The Palo Alto model is PA820 in HA Active-Passive mode. Its is connected through two leased-lines to a single ISP. So previously the working GP was aa.test.com  with public IP of 1.2.3.4, and the new domain name is bb.test.com  with an public IP configured as 5.6.7.8. Totally segregated. Although everything is set up by the book, we are having a certificate error whenever someone tries to connect to the new GP bb.test.com . The certificate error is happening with certificate of the old GP aa.test.com  being applied on to bb.test.com . This is delaying the clients who are waiting to connect through the new portal/GW. The things I have checked before coming to this forum,1. I have used a FQDN when configuring the Agent>External Gateway and the correct GP certificate is applied on their respective GP Portal/Gateway2. The Interface IP is static so I have not used loopback IP, correct me if I am wrong here that I need to use a dummy loopback IP instead of the interface IP while the interface IPs are statically set.3. The configuration for the GP portal/GW is correct and there is no configuration mix up/overlap between the two GW/Portals set up. 4. Separate public IP is used for each and different FQDN as well. 5. Separate Cert is created using letsencrypt and uploaded on the CertMgmt>Certificate.6. Separate tunnel is created and each tunnel is used for each GW/Portal(the new and the old one).Brief recap of the issue:Here is a quick recap of our session:=================================- The issue is with a newly configured Global Protect- The issue which you are facing is that the newly configured gp configuration is taking an old certificate.- The portal URL for Old is aa.test.com , and the New one is bb.test.com - The error that I am getting on client's pc is that The certificate CN name mismatch.

188,472396,GlobalProtect Discussions,campbech1,L1 Bithead,Odd GlobalProtect issue,"Just completed an install this last weekend and received a report that a user wasn't able to connect to GlobalProtect. I started with the normal troubleshooting and quickly realized this was going to be something more detailed. The user that initially complained said that she wasn't able to connect to GP. I asked them to just try to hit the portal with a web browser and make sure she could get there first. Nope, can't reach the portal via a browser. Next step I did some monitoring and packet captures on the firewall and verified I can see their traffic hitting the firewall on the GP portal address but I'm only seeing packets in one direction. I see the client hello in the packet capture but I don't ever see the server hello and then certificate exchange, it just stops there on the client. Performing a packet capture on the firewall I see in the tx capture that the server hello is being sent and also verified this with a packet capture downstream from the firewall. The server hello just never makes it to the remote client. The client is able to ping the GP portal fine. It appeared that this was an isolated issue with this one client, but I'm now finding that my cell phone, when on my home Internet, I'm able to connect, but on AT&T wireless I'm not. Any one have any ideas? One more piece to the puzzle. The client is able to connect to other devices with SSL on the same network here and is also able to VPN to the existing Cisco ASA that's here without any issues. The only issue is to the GP portal. I sat on a call with Palo support for the last two days without any resolution. Hardware: PA-460 in HAVersion: 10.1.4GP versions tried 5.2.10 and 6.0",0,"

192,471519,GlobalProtect Discussions,mb_equate,L2 Linker,GlobalProtect machine cert pre-login OR SAML,"My customer switched from a cloud URL filter to PAN-OS on-prem. For remote users to be filtered, they must be connected to the network in this case via GP. To force those endpoints to always be protected, the VPN must be always-on and ideally users prevented from disabling the client. Without pre-login or cert auth, the endpoint is unprotected until VPN is established. If the user fails to authenticate, the VPN fails and the endpoint is unprotected, so machine-cert based pre-login is mandatory. Customer also wants to auth users in AzureAD (via SAML) before allowing access to the network, and use the same portal & gateway for external users/devices with limited network access. Ideally pre-logon with machine cert followed by SAML should achieve this, but I can't get it working without requiring the machine cert for all devices incl. external. Those devices should _not_ hold a trusted machine cert and key, otherwise an external device could match a HIP profile for corporate/internal devices and be allowed additional access. The ideal process...Corporate device:Pre-login & GP gateway predefined in reg, machine cert installedGP authenticates machine to gateway using machine cert pre-login, network access is restricted (user cannot bypass URL filtering controls)User logs into deviceGP re-authenticates user to portal/gateway using SAMLPortal uses presence of machine cert for config selection, sets always-onUser/device combo gets privileged network access External device:GP authenticates user to portal/gateway using SAMLPortal uses absence of machine cert for config selection, sets on-demandUser/device combo gets restricted network access Building blocks:SAML auth profile for AzureADCert profile with root & issuing CAPortal referencing auth & cert profiles for client auth (Allow Authentication with User Credentials OR Client Certificate = Yes, because we want to allow endpoints without the cert to login)1st portal config using same cert profile for config selection criteria & setting connect method always-on (currently testing without pre-login) & tamper protection (don't allow users to disable/uninstall)2nd portal config with connect method on-demand, only gets matched if machine cert not present and allows external users to disable/uninstallGateway referencing auth & cert profiles for client auth (Allow Authentication with User Credentials OR Client Certificate = Yes, because we want to allow endpoints without the cert to login) On commit, we get a warning that ""no username field is configured in certificate profile "", I assume that's because we are using the OR option, and portal/gateway needs to be able to extract a username from a cert if it's either/or? From what we can see the effective result is AND, and only internal devices can connect - external devices are presented with the usual ""valid client certificate is required"" message as if both the cert and user auth are required. Internal clients are first authenticated by the certificate and subsequently SAML as there's no user associated with the certificate (I assume this is pre-login state?). When we set the Username field in the cert profile, external devices can login (using SAML) however internal device users are not re-authenticated, and I'm assuming this is because the OR operator is working and some ID was extracted from the cert (machine CN). Unfortunately those internal users don't match policy based on group membership because their identity was already extracted from the client cert (machine CN). IF it was possible for the machine cert to be used for pre-login (no Username field in the cert profile) while also allowing external devices to authenticate without the cert (GP auth OR option) this should work the way we need, ensuring those corporate machines are always connected (pre-login) while allowing external devices to connect on-demand (without the machine cert). Why it's breaking is because PAN-OS needs the Username field defined int he cert profile to support cert OR user creds. I think all these requirements lead to mutual exclusion without spinning up a new portal & gateway combo per site to support the external users.",0,"

213,438042,GlobalProtect Discussions,Ben-Price,L4 Transporter,GP IPsec tunnel always falling back to SSL,"Hi All, A customer recently migrated for 2 x PA-3020 to 2 x PA-460 running PAN OS 10.1.1. Since migrating they are having some odd issues with Global Protect, 90% of the time GP is connecting as SSL, even though IPsec is enabled on the tunnel, and when occasionally it does connect as IPsec, after 5 mins or some times a couple of hours it will fall back to SSL for a couple of users. Gateway and portal reside on a loopback interface in the internal zone, and the relevant NAT and security policy rules are allowing ipsec, ike, ssl and panos-globalprotect traffic into the loopback IP address. I am not seeing any significant load on the firewall and on average there are approx. 200 GP clients connecting in. GPS.log snippet below T2432) 09/29/21 08:25:55:810 Debug(2494): ----Tunnel creation

218,468355,GlobalProtect Discussions,ZachHeise,L0 Member,Using GlobalProtect on multi-user server to gain User-ID visibility - possible?,"We've enjoyed using globalprotect in combination with palo alto firewall policies over the past few years to allow particular policies to only apply to particular users, who are of course identified by the user signing into the globalprotect client. We were wondering if we could expand on this capability. We don't need VPN capability, we just want traffic from users signed into globalprotect to be tagged so it shows up in the 'monitoring' interface of the firewall web GUI as coming to/from particular users. Would it be possible to use GlobalProtect in this way?Can globalprotect be set up in a multi-user Windows server environment so that a single install of GP on a server could have multiple users all signed into their own 'instance' of globalprotect, so traffic from that server's IP address could be tagged so that 192.168.1.1 could have outgoing traffic tagged with users contoso\alice and contoso\bob at the same time? And then, secondly, to have globalprotect not actually sending traffic through a VPN tunnel, but just routing as normal - all we want is the user ID tagging. I figure this is a long shot but it would be super useful to us if it were possible.",0,"

We allow Split Tunnel, and one firewall has a 0.0.0.0/0 Include Access Route, and the other does not.  Both don’t have any Excluded routes. The one firewall (9.1.4) does have a Domain and Application Entry, Excluding *.webex.com and webex.com domain for testing this feature. Both firewalls, the GP App Config settings are: Split-Tunnel Option: Network Traffic Only and Resolve All FQDNs using DNS servers Assigned by the Tunnel: Yes; both are default and have not changed.About six months ago, we upgraded our GP clients from version 2.0.2 or 4.0.x to 5.0.8, and most are now on 5.2.3. We’ve noticed some DNS issues with some specific situations since the upgrade from 2.0.2 or 4.0.x. Problem 1: We have a handful of users who use GP to VPN to our network and, when needed, connect to an outside vendor’s VPN (Anyconnect) to access data at the vendor while still on our VPN (due to a vendor whitelist). When they connect to the vendor, the users cannot access their server or ours. Testing one user, we notice we can ping our internal DNS server or others, but DNS requests are not working. Using Wireshark and capturing the local, GP, and AnyConnect interfaces and filtering on port 53, there is no DNS traffic at all. At the command prompt using nslookup and using multiple DNS servers, there is no port 53 traffic. Also, checking the firewall, there is no port 53 traffic during this time. Both our VPN and the vendor have Split-tunneling allowed. Problem 2: On the GP gateway with the Domain Exclusion of webex.com, when a test user connects, they can access other sites, but webex.com won’t load. Using Wireshark and capturing the GP and local interfaces, I see reply DNS traffic from our internal DNS server to the user, but I don’t see the request from the user to the DNS server. Also, I see traffic for webex.com but trying to use both the GP and local interfaces. We did upgrade the GP client to version 5.2.6. Were there significant DNS behavior changes from our previous GP versions of 2.0.2 or 4.0.x to 5.0.8, which may account for the strange issues we are experiencing?Thank you for any help.Jeff",0,"

Enable Cert Revocation on the certificate profile (with Agent User Prelogon set to Any) - user reboots and PreLogon does not work. User can log in without issue. User Logs out of Windows, Prelogon is working. Looking at the logs it looks like the PreLogon is attempting to authenticate or sending the PreLogon user to SAML.

Dated 28/1 is with the PreLogon User Agent. Any ideas? Logs:PANGPA logs during testing: Date: 28/1/22(P6388-T9612)Debug(9098): 01/28/22 10:14:03:952 Saml auth(P6388-T9612)Dump (2373): 01/28/22

With both Portal agents configured for any user (I realise only the first would be used) we see good Pre-Logon and user connection – there are no issues with Globalprotect. We turn Certificate Revocation on any lost devices can have their certificates revoked and we see a problem with Pre-Logon. For certificate revocation we are only turning on the Use CRL and not the blocks. What we see is Pre-Logon fails when a laptop is booted but user login is good. When a User logs out, pre-logon works. It looks as if the pre-logon is trying to authenticate with SAML.PANGPA logs for Prelogon testing, I’ve highlighted some lines of interest highlighted as well as removing the “noise” but have left some context, if you want to search through it for my comments, do a search for <<- .I also still have the original file if you want it..<type>saml-pre-login</type> <<- this shouldn’t be SAML<status>Disconnected</status><protocol/><portal-config-version>4100</portal-config-version><error-must-show/><error-must-show-level>error</error-must-show-level><error/><product-version>5.2.10-6</product-version><product-code>&quot;{D3983688-3ECE-46AA-957C-DC4897ADC354}&quot;</product-code><portal-status>Connected</portal-status><user-name>Test-User</user-name><username-type>saml</username-type><state>Discovering network...</state><check-version>no</check-version><portal>Test-Portal</portal><discover-ready>no</discover-ready><mdm-is-enabled>no</mdm-is-enabled><gateway>Test-Portal</gateway><network-type>external</network-type><manual>no</manual><saml-auth-status>0</saml-auth-status><saml-auth-method>REDIRECT</saml-auth-method><saml-request>aHR0cHM6Ly9sb2dpbi5taWNyb3NvZnRvbmxpbmUuY29tL2NlNmViZTYyLTU1N2ItNDQzNi1hMTljLTc2N2VjYTJjZDQ1MS9zYW1sMj9TQU1MUmVxdWVzdD1sWkxMVHNNd0VFViUyRkpmSSUyQkwlMkJkVnJDWlNhQmRVS2lKcUFnczJ5SFVtcmFYRURoNEg4Zm1rTFlpeXFjUnlORmZuenR5WkpmS2hIMWs1MmFQYXdmc0VhSjNQb1ZmSXpvMmNURVl4elZFaVUzd0FaRmF3dW56Y011b0ZiRFRhYXFGNzRwU0lZS3pVYXFVVlRnT1lHc3lIRlBDODIlMkJia2FPMkl6UGNQSTNVRjl5S0JSMjZneFlzRVBRV1d4WEhrbjdnMDhPdktMMWMxY2RiekxGTHhFJTJGV1gwZXVEVk40Z2hkR29PNnRWTHhWNFFnJTJCJTJCZ0JUMmtGSTNTYks5TyUyRk5TbDRkM3dzM1NEQVNub28yVDBEOHRSWW16V2Vma0xZbzZHaWNRTE5KMkVYY3RkTkF1YUJTRVVTQkVtNGwwbGlGT3NGRm91Ykk1b1FHbGJoQzZOR3ZDa0FVSkM3Tlg0bFRmR2R4TDFVcDF1QjNZJTJGaUpDOXRBMGxWczkxUTF4WHNEZ2VjVlpRSXJsYVVKMk5qWlhoN2lONVQlMkZwayUyQkxmV1MlMkY5SzhmaVV2MzloJTJCSUwmUmVsYXlTdGF0ZT1DMkFGQUFlRGxXRXdNVGhoT0dKbE1UazVNemxoWW1aaFkyVTRPREJsTW1NMk1URmpNemsyT1ElM0QlM0Q=</saml-request><prelogin-cookie/><saml-prelogin-portal>no</saml-prelogin-portal><saml-chrome-sso-support/><saml-default-browser>yes</saml-default-browser><saml-request-id>0</saml-request-id></response> Date 27/1/22(P15864-T16284)Debug(1416): 01/27/22 11:05:24:836 Wait too long in connecting, display still working...(P15864-T16784)Debug(2212): 01/27/22 11:05:27:939OnSamlCallback -

Accompanying this we have deployed a separate gateway/Portal for Clientless VPN. Both Authenticating with LDAP. They have requested 2FA for their setup. Is it worth setting up 2FA for an Always On PreLogon setup - I don't think so at all? Probably best to set them up as OnDemand, SAML auth and O365 2FA which I have on another user setup. With regards to the Clientless VPN - can we set up 2FA on that without issues? I can't find specific documentation regarding this. In my view Auth could be set up as SAML (unless it can be done on LDAP) with O365 2FA. What's the view? They don't want any further costs with the solution. Regards Adrian",0,"

All this without any interruption or cut of the VPN.On the application settings of GlobalProtect we implemented all possible features to force the DNS resolution on our internal network DNS. There is also nothing that would make this site or this IP be in one of the Split Tunnel or local breakout rules in the GP-Gateway or Portal Settings... However, it seems that for some home-office users, the DNS resolutions is still made, some times only, through the local network adapter.Am sure is not a GlobalProtect problem, but more a problem with the local computer (Windows) network settings and management? I'm thinking especially about IPv6 which is enabled by default. Let me explain my thinking: I have never been affected by this problem because I have an FW that blocks all IPv6 traffic IN and OUT on my home network.I know that some ISP's, most of them, don't filter anything from this IPv6 on their Internet Box (modem/router) Is it possible that Windows, for latency problem reason in IPv4 (for example), quickly switches to IPv6-DNS resolution (that isn't active in GP), for performance reasons, and this is the reason why the connection to the URL is made on the public IP instead of the private IP ?Any Idea, solutions, workaround or comments ? Thank you!",0,"

There is no config change or GP client change on the end machine. As the logs are purging in almost one week but for one user I saw in the HIP report every HIP check was there still it matched wrong HIP object and now it is matching everything perfectly.We can see similar issue for various other users also. My HIP checks are as follows-Firstly the machine should be part of domain and secondly crowstrike should be installed.(Any version is fine).Any machine not matching either of this criteria are posed as non-compliance. We are nearing the final stage of this project, it will be great if you guys have any inputs or faced such issue",0,"

We use a financial package that has a fat app on the endpoint and connects back to an SQL db on campus. This app doesn't deal with packet loss very well and bombs out every now and then. We can replicate this onsite as well. We have multiple other apps, that operate in a similar fashion and never have any issues, just seems to be this one. We have contacted the provider and they told us to just use terminal services and the VPN is the problem. I have done multiple ping tests from home and my packet loss is always < 1%. I have done the same test with the user and sometimes the loss is up to 1% pinging the financial server over the VPN connection. Is this normal behaviour? I suppose some packet loss is expected, but what is an acceptable figure?Thanks for any help or insights into this.

These IPs were provided to 3rd parties to add to their whitelist in order for our users to be allowed to access secure systems/sites. However, one of these third parties advises that another customer has already asked for the same IPs to be whitelisted, therefore our request has been reverted due to security risk. My question to them was perhaps the other customer provided them with a bigger range, rather than the six /32 addresses we have provided. Alternatively, can anyone tell me whether gateway IPs within GP are designed to be shared, considering we are all set up with unique portal names? Thanks very much for your time, I'd appreciate any advice.",0,"

317,439753,GlobalProtect Discussions,jwcash,L4 Transporter,Issues using Elliptic Curve DSA certificates with GlobalProtect agent,"Anyone else come across this?  Anyone using ECDSA certs for their GlobalProtect Portal or Gateways?  Have you tried non-Windows/MacOS clients? Configuring GlobalProtect Gateways to use ECDSA certs instead of RSA certs breaks everything except Windows, MacOS, and mobile agents. As the SSL cert industry seems to be heading toward deprecating RSA certs in the 5-ish years, I thought I'd get a jump on things and test it out on our GP setup.  Added ECDSA certs to one Gateway, tested it with Windows and Android clients, and everything was good.  Ran it for a few weeks, and pushed it out to a second Gateway.  Tested that one with Windows, MacOS, and iOS client, and everything was good.  Pushed it out to all our Gateways except one, and no issues reported.  That was in July 2021. One of the clients is a Grandstream VoIP phone running an old version of Android that we use for work-from-home staff.  As it's Android-based, we can use the built-in VPN client to connect to GlobalProtect via X-Auth.  Worked great until school started again in September.  The staff member could not keep the phone online for an hour, let alone a full workday.  Calls were choppy, calls were dropped, phone locked up, all kinds of issues.  Switched the GlobalProtect Gateway back to using RSA certs ... and all the issues went away.  (Didn't fix this one until this week, so there's no support ticket in for this one.) Added a new user to one of the Gateways using ECDSA certs.  That user has an Ubuntu laptop.  Tried GP 5.2.x and 5.3.x (multiple versions of each).  Would not connect to the Gateway (Portal auth worked), would just hang the agent or give error messages about authenticating the server.  And you could not sign out of the agent, that option was missing from the client UI!  Had to force uninstall/install in order to change usernames in the agent, in order to test a connection to a different gateway.  Switched the GlobalProtect Gateway back to using RSA certs ... and all the issues went away.  (We have support tickets in for these two issues.) We've now removed all traces of ECDSA certs from our GlobalProtect infrastructure.",0,"

329,445955,GlobalProtect Discussions,gianluca_v,L1 Bithead,Strange issue with GlobalProtect Wi-fi vs Ethernet,"Hi Everyone, I need your help as I'm facing a very strange issue with GlobalProtect, the VPN used in my company.When I'm working from home I switch on my PC which is already connected to an ethernet cable: GlobalProtect connects almost immediately (usually to Europe Primary) and I'm able to access my company network drives, folders and remote desktops. However every operation is very slow: network folders take a lot of time to open on explorer, when I launch a RDP connection it takes a lot of time to log onto the the virtual machine and, above all, when I need to connect to oracle databases through ODBC it takes a lot of time to resolve such connections. Below the screenshot of the IPConfig (Ethernet Connection 3): look at the IPv6 and Temporary IPv6 addresses and keep them in mind. This is Ipconfig of the Ethernet Connection. Please note the presence of the IPv6 and Temporary IPv6 Addresses. If I disconnect the ethernet cable, activate the WiFi connection (from same Router and same ISP) and wait for GlobalProtect to reconnect then everything start to work as expected at a much faster speed: network drives open with a blink of an eye, ODBC Connections are resolved immediately and virtual machines are launched istantly. As you can see from the screenshot below (Wireless LAN Adapter), now the the IPv6 and Temporary IPv6 addresses have disappeared!  As I don't want to use WiFi because signal is very weak, I disconnect it and reconnect the Ethernet Cable. I wait for GlobalProtect to reconnect and everything works just fine as it was under WiFi. Infat now the Ipconfig looks different with respect to the first cabled connection when I switched on the PC: the Ethernet 3 does not have the IPv6 and Temporary IPv6 Addresses and it mirrors the settings of the Wireless LAN Adapter seen just above.  I really need your help to sort this issue out because it is very frustrating: each morning I need to connect with Lan Cable, then disconnect it, switch on WiFi, wait for GlobalProtect to connect, then switch off WiFi and finally connect LAN Cable again.What can I suggest my IT department to do? I'm not a technician but I suspect the issue is caused by this IPv6 Addresses that are wrongly assigned when the first connection to VPN is done through Ethernet Cable. Many thanks in advance,Gianluca",0,"

361,389545,GlobalProtect Discussions,jrauman,L2 Linker,GlobalProtect struggling with password changes,"We use our AD accounts to authenticate and connect GlobalProtect.  The first connection attempt requires the user to type their AD username and password.  GP saves the user's credentials at that point so subsequent connections do not require manual entry of creds.  All that works great. When a user changes their password in AD, they are told to disconnect and reconnect GP so that it can request their new password.  We expect GP to attempt one connection with their old password, fail to connect (incorrect password), and request the new password.  Instead we see the following behaviors:1. GP connects successfully with old, saved password instead of failing to connect and prompting the user for a new password.2. GP fails to connect, asks for a new password, but instead of using the new password, still retries the old password again (and fails again).   In both cases, the user gives up and calls IT.  IT sees the same behavior and manually signs the user out of GP and deletes any remaining creds in Credential Manager for GP.  So in some cases, GP is allowed to use an invalid password to connect (the user's old password still works even after it has been changed, meaning GP is NOT checking the password's validity with the domain controller).  In other cases, GP appears to be unable to overwrite the old password with the new one (despite the fact that that the old one keeps failing and the user keeps entering the new one). What is happening??? How can GP fail in both ways in the same day/week?  Rarely does it do exactly what it should do.  Which is simply a) fail on connect (wrong password), b) request new password, c) succesfully connect & save new password.",0,"

Also do we need to get Intermediate certificate only or also Root cert from Go Daddy for importing into PA Firewall for using it as trusted root CA for GP.  Re: Re-Generate SSL Certificate Can't Import SSL Certificate from GoDaddy for use on GlobalProtect Gateway/Portal ",0,"

This all works and allows printing & RDP to onprem services. We also have the Global Protect gateway on the same Palo Alto albeit on a separate subnetWe are starting to pilot win10 devices with global protect. The branch offices have a separate wifi which is essentially a public wifiThe setup is that they (intuned) Win10 device has 2 networks; when docked are hardwired into the IPsec router (so are connected to the LAN that is connected to Azure over IPsec tunnel), and when undocked are connected to the public wifi and Global Protect allows them to access 365/onprem resourcesWhat I'm unclear about is when the device is docked and therefore hardwired to the Draytek router so traffic flows over the IPsec tunnel and Global Protect is also connected - both methods have the same destination subnets incl. in their routing tables - device traffic flows through GP but; - is there an overhead with GP connecting through an IPsec tunnel? I imagine this will add to the latency at the very least I've tried configuring policy routing on the Draytek to force all traffic through the IPSec tunnel (so GP can be disabled when hardwired) but have struggled to set this up consistently across the various Draytek models that we have at the +70 sites, this would have allowed us to use the Palo for URL filtering etc Thanks in advance Ben  ",0,"

I have a few questions and I was hoping someone could guide me: 1-Whenever I try to authenticate with either method above, I get prompted for DUO twice, one for the portal, and one for the gateway (which makes sense). Is there a way to get around this without using cookies? 2-Assuming that cookies are required for question 1, is it ok to use the same certificate to encrypt/decrypt cookies, and also install the certificate along with the private key on the client? Unfortunately we don't have a way of pushing the certs to endpoints, so I have to rely on the firewall doing the installation. I am going to assume yes since it should be the same? Any security risk associated? 3-If I have to use cookies + certificate, is it ok to simply use a self signed Root CA for this? Or should it be the root + intermediate + client cert, and use the client cert to install on the device, and the root cert to do the encryption/decryption? Any help on this will be greatly appreciate it. Thank you in advance!   ",0,"

Is it just the local interface network which can't be accessed while Global protect is running - or does this effectively make split tunneling useless by locking out anything except the tunnel? I can't seem to find a definitive answer - it should just be what the wording says - lockout of the local LAN used to get internet access - but I've had situations where the logical interpretation of Palo Alto speak turns out to be not so logical before! Thanks for any input",0,"

I have setup and configured my Global protect VPN. When it comes to DHCP, I know I can't use my DHCP servers but have to rely on DHCP from the firewall. That is OK. My question is this: For my VPN users, If I create a DHCP scope in Network>GatewayS>MyGateway>Agent>Client Settings>Configs>IP Pools>IP Pool, and the DHCP addresses are not sub set of an existing Ethernet Interface\sub-interface, will I have to create a layer 3 sub interface so the VPN traffic is routed correctly?

I also don't think that Globalprotect provides/writes the VPN assigned IP address in the Active Directory during LDAP/Radius authentication process of the client to the VPN but maybe I wrong about this?  The option for the AD to assign the VPN address to Globalprotect seems nice but for 10000 of users it does not seem feasuble to assign a static ip address to each user in the Windows AD and I did not find if you can configure the AD to not use a static ip address but a pool of addresses and then write which ip address it provided to the Globalprotect for VPN assignment. https://knowledgebase.paloaltonetworks.com/KCSArticleDetail?id=kA14u0000008UkxCAE&lang=en_US%E2%80%A...  The other thing I thought is to export the Globalprotect logs to a syslog server and from there to get which VPN address was provided to which user or real client ip address (mapping between the VPN address and the real client Ip address).",0,"

499,423768,GlobalProtect Discussions,zsonyiAttila,L1 Bithead,Avoid GP Portal to forward user name to external gateway,"Hi everyone,  I bumped into a rather annoying issue with Global Protect. Context: We needed and external authentication source for MFA with our Global Protect deployment, so we set up OKTA SSO (with SAML) for our Global Protect Portal. In order to Group mapping to work with the external Okta directory, we needed to set up an LDAP profile, configure user mapping and configure the Okta Global Protect app to send username in the DOMAIN\username format. (we need group mapping to work for config selection and Clientless VPN apps). It works as expected, on Portal login, the users are redirected to Okta for sign in, and on successful auth, the user is logged in to the Portal. And here's my issue. For External Gateway we need another authentication source (in this case an internal LDAP profile) AND client cert authentication. The authentication fails on the external gateway with the error ""Username in client cert is different from the input"". That is because, the client cert CN = username, but the portal forwards the username to the external gateway in myorg-okta.com/username format. As a workaround I tried to set the Certificate profiles' (linked to the External Gateway Auth Tab) Username field from ""Subject"" to none. Result was the External GW auth window popped up, the username field was auto filled with myorg.okta.com\username prompting for password. Now if I delete the DOMAIN part of username input, the client can successfuly authenticate against the internal LDAP profile. Problem is, the users would need to manually delete the DOMAIN part of the username each time they log on. I tried the authentication modifiers in the internal auth profile but it didn't work out. Because the internal LDAP profile points to Active Directory, the %USERDOMAIN%\%USERINPUT% format doesn't work, as AD does not support DOMAIN\username format with the sAMAccountName attribute. When I try 'None' with authentication modifiers it strips the DOMAIN name part of the username as expected, but because of that I run into ""Matching client config not found"" issue, and that's because the Agent configuration is linked to user groups existing in the internal AD. Maybe I'm missing something obvious, but my question is, is there a way to prevent the Global Protect Portal to forward the username (used to log in to the Portal) to the external gateway automatically? Or in another way, can I ""present"" a completley blank authentication form for users trying to log in to the External Gateway? Kind regards,  Attila     ",0,"

505,422642,GlobalProtect Discussions,Adam_Kalabadzi,L1 Bithead,Single Portal with Multiple Gateway without GSLB | What happen when the Portal is down ?,"Hi Folks, I have PaloaltoFirewall on DC and DRC, and we are going to configure GlobalProtect for SSLVPN.I understand that we can configure multiple gateway on the Portal, so that when one gateway is down it can failover to the next available gateway.Let say i configure the Paloalto on DC as the Portal. And the Gateway consist of Paloalto DC (highest Priority) and DRC (as a backup).Q1 : The IP address which we should publish to the user to connect is the IP Address of the Portal right ?Q2 : Then the portal will push 2 Gateway information to the user. They will automatically connect to gateway DC. Then what will happen on the user side when the users is connected to the gateway DC, and suddenly the gateway DC down which means the Portal is down as wellQ3 : What will happen, when the paloalto DC is down, and there is a user trying to connecting his globalprotect client ?Q4 : Is there any way to make the VPN service still availbale for the user when the Portal is down, without GSLB ? whitout user interferency to change ip / something on their GP agent ? Thanks fo all the answer",0,"

Other users have no problem seeing folders on GP.  I searched Known Issues, but didn't find this symptom.  All are Windows 10 Enterprise, 1903.  64bit/8gb of RAM.  We like GP as TEAMS works better with it, but we need our files too.  Thoughts on what is going on and how to fix?",0,"

507,422348,GlobalProtect Discussions,EndUser_Tech,L0 Member,Global Protect PANGP Virtual Ethernet Adapter disabled after Jun21 MS Security patches. (KB5003974 suspected),"Starting after Microsoft Cumulative and Security updates released in June 2021, our users have been experiencing issues where they are unable to connect to Global Protect after resuming from a reboot or sleep. The blue ""connect"" button is present, and our portal is selected, but clicking the button does nothing. The PANGP Virtual Ethernet Adapter is in a disabled state and cannot be enabled, even with administrative privileges. The issue is subsides when the user reboots the laptop between 3-6 times, but will re-occur sporadically after reboots or the device goes to sleep. This has been observed on multiple versions of Global Protect (5.0.7-2, 5.2.4-21, 5.2.5-84,5.2.7) and on multiple device models (surface, dell), but all on Windows 10 1909 build. We suspect that KB5003974 is the cause of these issues, but have been able to roll back that update in any of our trials. Subsequent updates, such as July 21 patches, seem to cause the issue to re-occur.The only way we've been able to determine to permanently address the issue is to fully scrub the Global Protect app from the users' device; removing registry entries, deleting the PanGPS service, clearing the WMI Cache entries, and deleting all file paths associated with the app before running a fresh install. Has anyone else experienced this or similar issues since applying June Cumulative/Security patches to 1909 Windows 10 systems? Is there a tool available that would allow us to completely scrub the app from users' systems without having to do the manual steps? Trying to complete these tasks in a remote work environment is exceedingly difficult.     ",0,"

We have spoken with support, and they insist that the limit is gateway + portal, even though I can continue to add ports and push the config to our PA-850 with no issues, and that it is in direct contradiction with what the published documentation states. I have also tested by deleting 2 portals (4 remaining) and still cannot add a 6th external gateway, with 1 internal gateway. We are getting no help from support, and getting frustrated with the lack of a path to resolution. I can accept it if the gateway limit is indeed 6 (or combined limit of 12 for gateway + portal), as long as it is states clearly as such in any published documentation. Anyone else ran into a similar situation?",1,"

We are  moving to MFA for VPN in the near future. Just wondering if the Windows store app will ever support that  or if we need to deploy the full client going forward? Currently when I try to connect to an MFA server the MS Store app just times out. There are no other messages or prompts.  Thanks,0,"

512,421389,GlobalProtect Discussions,andrew.jeon,L0 Member,creating split tunnel on full tunnel enforcement,"Hi We’ve recently discovered that the Mac GlobalProtect client does not terminate existing network connections after full tunnel with no access to local network is established. This is reproducible In the following procedure:In practice, this allows one to create a split tunnel. We’ve had several folks test this by RDPing into a system on their home network, and being able to continue to control the system after the VPN connection is established. There is no “reconnect”, it appears to be uninterrupted. Other VPN solutions like Anyconnect, Pulse secure (both full tunnel with no access to local network) successfully terminate existing connection. This is a security concern as this would be usable as a covert C2 channel.  Does anyone have any suggestions on terminating existing connection on Mac?     ",0,"

We have two ISP Internet connections on two different campuses. We are using trunking to carry the different VLANs, so the outside networks are on the same physical interface. The inside network is on another physical interface. We have static routes setup for the two class C – 192.168.10.0 and 192.168.11.0. I tried to setup a static route for the other network, but that doesn’t work. See diagram. I am able to get two of the class C addresses working correctly; however, I cannot get a ping response back from the third class C address (192.168.14.0/24) assigned to the PA from outside. I do get a response from a PC on the same network. I have a PC  (192.168.14.250) in the third class C subnet that does respond to ping, so I know that the router is working correctly. I’m not sure if this is a routing issue with the PA or something else. Please let me know if I need to provide additional information.  ",0,"

As we enabled the users, wo work from home, we experienced lot's of issues regarding name resolution, since IPv6 an LLMNR interferes with the classical IPv4 DNS way.As a result, we deployed a script, which disables IPv6 on all interfaces, so communication outside of the defined IPv4 way is not possible. On a regular security audit, our pentest guy noticed, that IPv6 was enabled on the globalprotect tunnel adapter, but nobody enabled it and we even got logs from our custom script, that all of the IPv6 communication were successfully disabled. Now the big question is - what software component enabled IPv6 again?Maybe anyone has an idea, which logs/locations to check.The script disables IPv6 on the interfaces with powershell ""Disable-NetAdapterBinden -name <> -ComponentID ms_tcpip6"". That survives a reboot as well.Maybe that's even related to Windows updates or with GlobalProtect tunnel adapters expected behavior? GlobalProtect latest 5.2 release, Windows 10 latest stable release Looking forward to your ideas - many thanks",0,"

They can re-authenticate and return to work, so the setup is fine for most day-of-work use. But the user experience is poor for those working longer. Coming from Checkpoint and ASA, both these products offer a re-authentication window, 5-10 mins before connectivity expires, to allow the user to reauthenticate and gain another 10hrs of tunnel time, without any hard cut off.  Is this possible in GP and if so, how? Are we missing a setting or confusing the way expiry works on the certs, etc?",0,"

563,408400,GlobalProtect Discussions,gvyskocil,L2 Linker,Wildcard cert,I recently setup a backup internet provider and bought a wildcard cert instead of renewing our previous cert. Previously just had a cert for remote.mydomain.com we used for globalprotect from network solutions. I have external DNS A records set for remote.mydomain.com with an ip from our main provider. I also set up an A record for remote2.mydomain.com with an ip from the backup provider. I have not created any automatic failover for GP. I was looking at just manually have GP users change to the secondary portal if our main goes down. I have seen some articles when doing this without a CA but not sure on the exact procedure when using a CA for the wildcart cert. I also have certs generated by the firewall I used as the trusted root cert and SSL decryption certs. I was hoping to use the one wildcard cert for all of these now. I recall having an issue in the past because I believe network solutions also has intermediate certs I needed to account for. Looking for pointers if anyone has been through a setup like this before. Thanks in advance,0,"

581,407807,GlobalProtect Discussions,RSteffens,L3 Networker,Global Protect messes up my DNS route table on MacOS,"Hello!  Quick question. I just configured global protect.  When I first configured it, I was sending all traffic through the tunnel which wasn't working well.  So afterword I set it to allow split tunneling.  But here's the problem: The first computer (MacOS) which I enrolled in GP when I was forcing all traffic through the tunnel, now will not connect to the internet when connected to GP, although it does connect to GP assets fine.  Another MacOS computer that I enrolled after I turned on split tunneling, works to access internet perfectly as well as GP assets    Turns out this is a DNS issue on the first computer. The routing table in the troublesome computer reveals I have duplicate DNS entries in the routing table, two that are pointing to the IP I receive after connecting to the GP gateway (these have priority as they appear first in the list), and two more that are pointing where they should.  When I manually update my routing table to remove the DNS entries pointing to the IP I receive after connecting to the GP gateway, all my troubles vanish, I can access the GP assets, as well as my local network.  However restarting the computer and reconnecting to GP restores the routing table to the incorrect state.  When I disconnect from GP, the rogue DNS entries disappear and my routing table behaves normally allowing normal internet access. When I reconnect to GP, my DNS routing table entries again are messed up. I have deleted the GP app and re-installed, but the incorrect routing table entries are still there.  I have flushed my routing table completely, but upon connecting to GP, the rogue DNS entries in the routing table mysteriously appear.  As I said above, I enrolled a second computer in GP and it connects normally and doesn't have the rogue DNS entries.  It's just the first computer that is messed up now, the one I enrolled when I was still forcing all traffic to use the GP tunnel. Any idea what I can do to fix the problem?  ",0,"

629,396183,GlobalProtect Discussions,MichaelMedwid,L2 Linker,Using corporate wildcard certificate for Global Protect,To get up and running with GP I set things up with a locally generated a root cert on the PAN and then generated a server cert tied to the root cert. The server certificate used the IP address of the outside interface as the Common Name. Then I created an SSL profile which pointed to the server certificate.  Everything works well although it has the initial error to push through about the certificate when using GP. Now I'd like to use our corporate wildcard certificate instead of the locally generated one. So say we're acme.com and we have *.acme.com certificate. How do I add that to the SSL profile and GP portal and gateway such that GP gives no error when trying to connect? I tried just importing the wildcard cert and selecting that into the SSL Profile and I got errors with the GP client. So I must be missing something. Thanks.,0,"

We are having issues with GlobalProtect Cert authentication when users travelling and connecting to a captive portal, where some captive portals represent their cert to the FW portal(man in the middle). This causes the FW to reject the connection as the cert doesn't match what is configured on the cert profile for cert authentication. I have few questions: - Does Portal Cert authentication and Gateway cert authentication follow same process? By that I mean, does Gateway cert authentication happen before the tunnel is created, or after tunnel is created and cert presented inside the tunnel(which could solve the issue)? - Is there an alternative way for identity authentication? for example, using a water mark authentication like a unique Reg key in  Windows registry like using custom checks? any other thoughts/suggestion for identity authentication? Thanks!  ",0,"

If it's not the case, the static route will be automatically removed from the routing table and the gateway will not be accessible anymore. Option 2 - PBR instead of static route monitoringYou could also perform a very similar approach with a PBR policy but I tend to prefer the static route for something that is not changing too often. Option 3 - Default route monitoringOne last very aggressive option I could think of would be: you don't change anything on your firewall but you add a path monitoring condition to the firewall default route. This way, if the firewall is losing connectivity to the internal network, it'll remove its default gateway and will lose internet connectivity.  thanks RegardsD.",0,"

644,393427,GlobalProtect Discussions,OsamaKhan,L2 Linker,Found VAPT vulnerabilities points for SSLVPN URL.,"We have done the VAPT on our environment and found the vulnerabilities for the SSLVPN URL which we use. We had mitigated the maximum points but five points are remaining. So need help on that.  1. Password sent in Clear Text - CWE-319.Some applications transmit passwords over unencrypted connections, making them vulnerable to interception. To exploit this vulnerability, an attacker must be suitably positioned to eavesdrop on the victim's network traffic. This scenario typically occurs when a client communicates with the server over an insecure connection such as public Wi-Fi, or a corporate or home network that is shared with a compromised computer. 2. Forced Browsing - CWE-285.It was observed that The web application does not adequately enforce appropriate authorization on all restricted URLs, scripts, or files. 3. Absence of CSRF tokens.No Anti-CSRF tokens were found in a HTML submission form.A cross-site request forgery is an attack that involves forcing a victim to send an HTTP request to a target destination without their knowledge or intent in order to perform an action as the victim. The underlying cause is application functionality using predictable URL/form actions in a repeatable way. The nature of the attack is that CSRF exploits the trust that a web site has for a user. By contrast, cross-site scripting (XSS) exploits the trust that a user has for a web site. Like XSS, CSRF attacks are not necessarily cross-site, but they can be. Cross-site request forgery is also known as CSRF, XSRF, one-click attack, session riding, confused deputy, and sea surf. 4.No logout option - CWE-613.It was observed that the target web application has no logout option. 5.Referrer-Policy Header is not implemented - CWE-200It was observed that Referrer-policy is not implemented in the response header.Referrer-Policy is a security header designed to prevent cross-domain referrer leakage.  Thanks In advance,    ",0,"

693,383670,GlobalProtect Discussions,jrauman,L2 Linker,Switching from GlobalProtect username & password to some sort of SSO solution (on-prem AD only),"We have always used username & password for authenticating GlobalProtect (using the user's AD account/password). We always connect GlobalProtect AFTER signing on to Windows first.  So how difficult would it be to have GlobalProtect simply query Windows for the user's current signed-on creds to use instead of manually typing them? Essentially something like SSO? And is it possible to setup a 2nd gateway option for testing so we don't impact our current users?  Basically, if users are connecting to vpn.contoso.com, we would create vpntest.contoso.com on the PA and use that to test this new configuration.   NOTE: I don't want to do pre-login or anything like that. And we don't have SAML as an option or AD Federated Services.  Just a very basic Active Directory 2016 domain, a single Palo Alto Firewall and GlobalProtect 5.1.5 for Windows 10.  ",0,"

699,382997,GlobalProtect Discussions,Scott.Ainslie,L0 Member,GlobalProtect SSL vs IPSec,"Help me come to grips with this. I recently enabled IPSec on our PAN for end user VPN's. I did it primarily to hopefully get improved VoIP performance, less jitter, and perhaps a marginal speed improvement. What I have found is an almost across the board doubling of download speeds. If you consider that most of my users are on regular consumer Xfinity cable links when using SSL their speed test would average around 15 - 20Mbps. Switching to IPSec changes that to 30 - 50Mbps pretty reliably. Happy, but not what I was expecting and I am trying to understand where the bottleneck is in SSL? Both data and management CPU's are running mostly below the 20's and haven't noticeably changed after moving to IPSec. I know that IPSec has lower overhead, quicker connection establishment and doesn't suffer from the TCP inside TCP that SSL (TLS) has but I wasn't expecting this big of a difference. I am left thinking the bottleneck is in the encryption methods either on the firewall or in the GlobalProtect client. PanOS 9.1.4, GlobalProtect 5.2.3 Thoughts?",0,"

719,343299,GlobalProtect Discussions,KCCommsTeam,L1 Bithead,Internal Host Detection Issue,"Hi there, I have a question on the correct use of internal host detection and internal/external gateway config. The behaviour I want to achieve is when a client is internal to the LAN GlobalProtect will detect this and not bring up the tunnel and pass all network traffic transparently out the LAN connection, as if it wasn’t there. When external, the client tries to establish the tunnel. I have no requirement to tunnel internal traffic, it needs to traverse the LAN as if GlobalProtect wasn’t there. I have an external gateway & portal configured, there is no internal gateway. A “no NAT” rule and policy are set up so the client machines can communicate with the external gateway, even if they are internal. I understand this is best practise so clients will get config changes from the firewall regardless of where they are connecting from. The NAT & policy that allow this are working as I can communication in the logs from internal clients. No direct access to the local network is enabled and app is in “always on” mode as I want all traffic to be forced down the tunnel if the client is external to the LAN. When clients are external to the network, everything works fine and as designed. However with internal clients, there can be a delay in connecting, sometimes 30 seconds or longer before it realises it is on the internal LAN, and GlobalProtect backs off. Sometimes the yellow “connecting” message appears, asking you to be patient. Some clients are fine, and immediately detect the internal LAN and back off. A small number of clients will not detect they are on the internal LAN at all. After the user authenticates, the GlobalProtect client tries to do something, then falls back to disconnected state. Firewall logs show the authentication and client configuration was successful, so something strange is happening on the client side. In this situation the app appears to be allowing some outbound network traffic from the device to the local LAN, but no inbound, resulting in an internal client that is orphaned from the network. Clearly something isn’t quite right, how can I achieve the behaviour I want? On internal host detection the documentation says “The GlobalProtect app connects to the internal gateway after performing internal host detection to determine the location of the endpoint.” What is the client behaviour once it detects it is internal to the network? I don’t have an internal gateway configured, could this be the problem? Is the client looking for an internal gateway? Many thanks,",0,"

Then when I go to connect, it contacts the server just fine, accepts my AD login info and RSA token, but then ultimately fails to create the VPN connection.Running the VPN on the host (with the VirtualBox network set to NAT mode) works... for some of our applications. The internet connection tunnels through, but there are certain domains that are inaccessible from within the guest OS. I'm thinking it's a DNS issue, but I'm honestly not much of a networking guy and am not quite sure how to approach the problem.In searching online I've seen several posts on various sites that recommend adding a second network adapter to the VM, using bridged mode, or paravirtualized mode, or host-only mode. I have tried every possible combination I can think of there but can't seem to get it working. I would prefer to get the VPN client running INSIDE the VM (which is how we used Checkpoint before) since that gives our users the option to use the host connection as normal and only the VM is tunneled through the VPN. But if that isn't possible I will settle for getting the VM to fully utilize the host's VPN connection instead.Does anyone have experience with a setup like this? Any advice on how I can get GlobalProtect to properly install inside a Windows 7 VM? Or perhaps a different VPN client that I can use to connect to a Palo Alto firewall? Any help would be greatly appreciated.",0,"

730,375566,GlobalProtect Discussions,grenzi,L3 Networker,Load balance a clientless application,"Hello evrybody,   some of our customers make heavy use of the Clientless VPN feature of the GlobalProtect Portal, and one of the most used application this time is the Apache Guacamole remote desktop gateway (https://guacamole.apache.org/). The GP Portal is configured to show the icon of this app and clicking on the app, of course, the remote users access the web server (NGINX in reverse proxy mode) through which the application is served. As you know, when using the clientless feature, all the requests made by the remote clients are proxied by the firewall, so from the application server's point of view all the connections originate from the same IP address (the IP of the firewall interface facing the application). This is working very fine for us but, with the ever growing number of remote users, a single Guacamole server is no more enough to manage all the necessary concurrent connections. So we need to add more Guacamole servers and put those servers behind a load-balancer (i.e. HAProxy or NGINX itself). In this fashion, the clientless app on the GP Portal is configured to point to the load balancer address instead of the address of the Guacamole server. The problem is: how can we load balance and ensure stickiness of the connections if all the user requests are coming form the firewall IP address? I already asked to the customer support to know if the firewall can inject an XFF in the HTTP requests, but it's not possible. Any idea?",0,"

This is a problem because the VPN needs to connect BEFORE the user logs in, so there will be no user certificate available. I spoke to Palo support and they told me this is by design and pre-logon needs both certificates. This seems strange to me...surely this can work with only computer certificates? SettingsPortal:Gateway:If anyone can offer any advise as to how to get this to work with only computer certificates that would be great. Thanks, Brian   ",1,"

This log on allows basic VPN connectivity to make sure their machine is patched/AV updated, etc. I am now looking for a way to escalate the network privileges to allow full access to the rest of the network. What I am not sure is, on how to get some type of extra layer of authentication to where the user will now log in using 2FA, such as a token to gain this access. What does Global protect offer to perform this next level of authentication? I am thinking of a web page redirect that when the user opens a web browser, they are taken to a splash page to input their username/token. So lets say their initial connection has an ACL like, VPN network permit to networks A,B and C. They are denied access to all other networks (This is a full tunnel so that would include internet). After they hit the redirect and are authenticated using their Token, they now have a allow any any ACL (for example). I am looking to perform this with out any HIP checks (if possible). Thanks in advance for your help!",0,"

But it should use the device certificate to do so. For some unknown reason, with some of our users (yes not all !?!) at a certain moment something happens (yes very vague so far).The device will start trying to create a tunnel with seemingly user authentication (because 2FA request is triggered), before any user actually logs in to Windows.So, for some reason the agent is no longer trying to create a device tunnel with the device certificate. It is all of sudden trying to create a (prelogon) tunnel with user creds.Since the 2FA request is triggered, I assume that the username and password have been succesfully provided by saved credentials. Because the cookie lifetimes are configured so, they are no longer valid the next morning.  ",0,"

805,350026,GlobalProtect Discussions,Klaverblad,L2 Linker,Documentation on Global Protect,"Hello, I'm looking for documentation about Global Protect. The default help pages only summarize the menu options in the gui. Typically they contain no explanation about its context or purpose.Examples of things I really can't intuitively find about global protect:- Is it supported on an active/active firewall? - Are there any documents with examples and bestpractices configuring such a scenario?- More specific question right now: IP Pools for clients can be configured at two levels (client and gateway), but what is the difference and why/when would I choose between the two?- Apparantly the IP Pools in the gateway config do not work with DHCP but with some kind of ill-described preferences?- Do the firewalls sync the used IP addresses?- Are the reservations synced? Documentation says the configuration is synced if the gateway is configure with a floating IP.- Why do clients store Preferred IP addresses (up to 3) in the registry and use a fourth in the actual interface?- Why does the registry contain references to multiple Portal configs if we only have 1 portal? It's not explained and from a admin perspective only one active config would make sense. Please advise.",0,"

This seems to work, but if the cookie-lifetime is expired, will I have to fill in the credentials twice again? Thank you for any hint.",0,"

809,348487,GlobalProtect Discussions,scottjackson,L0 Member,Clientless VPN and HTTP Redirects,"Hi I am attempting to use the Clientless VPN feature to give access to an internal web proxy server but have an issue where the Palo Alto is not rewriting URL's from a HTTP 301 Redirect.   We use inginx/vouch as the proxy server to provide single sign on functionality to our web applications. Part of the process for this authentication is that if a non-authenticated user hits inginx, the HTTP session is handed off to vouch that issues a HTTP 301 redirect to the client browser which contains another internal URL where the user can perform their log in. The issue is this internal URL is not re-written by the Global Protect portal so the user's browser is performing a name lookup and trying to go over the Internet to access the URL which is internal to our network only.  Does anyone know if the clientless VPN supports rewriting of HTTP 301 Redirect? ThanksScott  ",0,"

As a test we have managed to setup a second GP portal instance working with Microsoft authenticator (RADIUS) on-demand, via the loopback method. This allows us to log in (after being prompted by authenticator) and download the client, but once the GP client is installed and we try to connect it just comes up with the error saying  ""Error: No network Connectivity.

We now want to expand this setup with needing a machine certificate to be allowed to log on to portal/gateway so only company owned computers can log in. We created a new CA and machine certificate on our PA-820, then chose this new CA in a new cert profile with ""Username field"" set to ""None"". We then added this new cert profile to the authentication tab on both our GP Portal and our GP Gateway. On the machine we have tested this new setup we have installed the created CA cert without private key in the ""Trusted root certificates"" store and the machine cert with private key signed by this CA in the ""Personal"" store under computer certificates. The portal config > agent > app settings says ""look for client certificate"" in ""Machine"". When we navigate to the portal website it says ""Valid client certificate is required"" and does not prompt us to use authenticate us with our installed certificate. However when we log onto the VPN with the GP app it does not require any certificate. It works for users both with and without the certificate installed... Any thoughts on why we can't get this to work as expected?",0,"

They simply would not connect. The changes I made were as follows 1. Minimum TLS version set to TLS 1.22. Modified shared ssl-tls profile settings as followsOne of these settings simply broke global protect - I had to revert them all (except the SHA1 and RC4) Has anyone come across his, and know of a solution on he Windows 7 end?

I'm a bit wary of adding them into VPN access because I'm not confident all of them are diligent in maintaining virus scanners and definitions. If I configure a HIP object which simply has ""Anti-Malware"" set to ""Is Installed"", with real-time protection enabled and virus definition age set to a maximum of 3 days old but don't add any vendor or product names, will that catch the majority of use cases? Or do I have to list every possible vendor to catch them all? Thanks",0,"

This issue is preventing automated jobs from running properly unless someone is RDPed into the machine. I have been working with the vendor (and my own Google-fu) on this issue for a month to no avail and would appreciate any help or suggestions. The setup:Local (home) machine: Windows 10 HomeRemote machine: Windows Server 2019 Standard. GlobalProtect 4.1.11-9 I set up a simple connection-checking logger and have narrowed the problem to the RDP sessions closing. I have reason to believe that the choice of local machine does not matter since I am able to resolve the issue by RDPing from other local machines. It seems that as long as the display on the remote machine is active, the GP VPN works fine. Once the display is inactive the VPN connection drops. I thought that maybe my entire network connectivity was dropping when the remote machine was in sleep - but using a logger and running jobs that connect to the internet I was able to verify that the internet connection is working as expected. I am happy to provide more details. Thank you for reading.",0,"

843,340161,GlobalProtect Discussions,jjfranzen,L0 Member,Gateway side not seeing Satellite published subnet,"I've just set up a PA-850 as a satellite to my main 3050 and the connection seems good. All the subnets published by the Gateway can be seen by systems on the Satellite side. However, the subnet being published by the Satellite can't be seen on the Gateway side. According to the Satellite Info section of the GP Gateway, it does see the satellite is publishing the subnet, but I can't ping anything on the subnet, even from the PA-3050's cli. Looking at the runtime routing stats, I do see that subnet as being routed to the next hop of the IP for the IPSec tunnel that was established when the satellite connected. So, even that looks proper. I have rules to allow traffic both to and from the zone created for the satellites, and since I am getting traffic from one direction I have to assume this is some kind of simple misconfig somewhere that is keeping the gateway side from properly routing across the tunnel to the satellite. Any suggestions as to where I can look to nail this down would be appreciated since both of my VAR's PAN experts have been stumped by this... Cheers, J. J. Franzen",0,"

This works like charm.Now, we want to start using the AZURE MFA option that we have configured on our ADFS servers.I’ve managed to setup the SAML between the ADFS servers (2016) and the palo alto but I can’t seem to get the VPN working.I’ve followed this guide to setup the SAML authentication.https://docs.paloaltonetworks.com/pan-os/9-0/pan-os-admin/authentication/configure-saml-authenticati...Unfortunately, after following this guide, it didn’t work. I didn’t get any assertation values. I then removed the certificate from the ADFS server in the relaying party trust.Now I’m seeing the incoming claims but still no luck.Then I found this article: https://www.reddit.com/r/paloaltonetworks/comments/8gsp9b/saml_sso_with_microsoft_adfs/and this: https://live.paloaltonetworks.com/t5/general-topics/adfs-saml-configuration/td-p/144886/page/2I added the 5 claims and set my user attributes.Hooray I’m able to login to the portal now. However, if I try to login with the global protect client, I get the question to login to my ADFS but then the client hangs on connecting. If I check the authd log, I see that it uses a username consisting of letters and numbers.Next step. I removed the all the claims and I’m now sending samaccountname as a claim and I changed the username attribute also to samaccountname on the palo alto.I see the username name now in the authd log, but login does not work. The reason was that on the gateway, I configured to only allow only certain groups to be able to login to the gateway. If I set those users to any, the logon works!The bad news is, now I’m unable to login to the portal.I guess I’m having a problem setting the correct claims but I’m not sure to what exactely.Anyone that has a similar setup that wants to share their configuration please? 😊Thanks",0,"

I've imported the certificate setup the right decryption rules and exclusions etc. and things seem to working. When i check the certificate using Chrome i can confirm it is using ssl decryption i also see the traffic on our firewall. Onfortunately a lot of application are not working. I've got the google play store excluded from ssl decryption already and that seems to be working fine, but still a lot of applications are not ok with the ssl decryption so it seems. My Ssl decryption setup using a laptop is working fine btw.  Is this normal on androids? is android working with more cert stores ? there something i can do to make this work without excluding all these applications? Another thing i came across is that the network exclusion for my local private network is not working, i see the request coming in on the firewall. When testing this config on my laptop win 10, it is working... is this by design? thanks guys.  regards, Lennart  ",0,"
