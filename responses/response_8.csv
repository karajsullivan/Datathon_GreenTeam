3,483942,JBrooks,"I attempted a similar report on my system and it ran successfully. Unfortunately, I can tell you what the error code is referring to when you run your report. When you open your case, make sure to include the request ID error and your prisma account/tenant information.Before opening a case, I would try the following:1. Verify your prisma cloud service account is current with the correct read permissions for the cloud account.2. Try running another compliance report. Perhaps on a different cloud account or cloud service provider.This may help you to identify if it is common issue or unique to this compliance report.Hope this helps.",0,05-02-2022,09:12 AM
