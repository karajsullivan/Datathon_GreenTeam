I can see traffic hitting the firewall, but allow traffic log show only byte send and no return traffic. Packet capture on the destination (for both east-west and inbound) doesn't show traffic to be arriving, so it looks like once FW inspect the packet and send back to GWLBe it doesn't send it in the correct direction.If overlay routing is disabled everything works - east-west, inbound and outbound. I found some old discussions mentioning issues with overlay routing, but from what I understand those know issues were for version 10.0.x, while we have tested with 10.2.1 and 10.1.6  NGFW AWS ",1,"

We are using a transit gateway deployment, and have all traffic going through a secuirty vpc which houses a pair of PA-VM's. These firewalls are reached by the other VPC's through GWLB's. Because of this architecture when we are allowing inbound web traffic to our ALB's we actually create a rule using the private ip addresses of the ALB's. The issue is the dynamic nature of the ALB these internal IP's change periodically, which in turn invalidates our inbound rules. I have seen some workarounds using NLB, or through Global Accelerator. Neither of these however will keep the private ip of the ALB from changing. I was hoping to use the dynamic group function, but it seems to only be able to pull in EC2's, and not LB's.

Though one key issue we have not been able to resolve is the GWLB target group has all the PA's as unhealthy, and no amount of changing interfaces and GWLB plugins has been able to resolve this issue, this approach on an ongoing basis is operationally bad. One method we've been able to resolve this is by using target groups that target IP rather than INSTANCE and targeting the Management interface, this then comes up as healthy as expected. Now this approach isn't ideal as we now need to write lambda's to manage auto scaling events etc, which is more effort when ideally the GWLB should be able to pick up the health check when an instance based target group is used. My question is, has anyone encountered this issue and been able to resolve it without having to use IP based target groups?",0,"

This is to do with HTTP(S) traffic with a GET verb and Health Checks in AWS.  This is a pre-existing system deployed in AWS as EC2s and I'm wondering if I'm missing something obvious. I'm trying to see if there is a way of injecting something unique about each firewall to identify which firewall some HTTP(S) traffic came through.  This can be anything, I'm really not picky: Internal IP, AWS Instance ID, hostname, MAC address, anything that is unique.  .  The incoming request for this port will always be a GET and there is nothing at AWSs load balancers that will let me differentiate, so I'm hoping the PALO can add something. Injection can be either as a header, a query parameter, or change the GET to a POST and add some JSON body to it with some unique data, I'm open to anything.   The PALOs are Active/Active with the same firewall configuration on each, so I don't think I can hard code any values in the ""Http Header Insertion"" --> Custom Headers section. I may have missed something very obvious (be gentle - its my first post here and I tried to do my research first).  If I have, or you have any suggestions, I'm open to any ideas If it makes any difference the devices are at PAN-OS 10.1 Thank you",0,"

Apart from hosts not allowing ping on hops it completed, but listed the end host I was checking several times in output: 1    <1 ms    <1 ms    <1 ms  10.10.32.1  2    <1 ms    <1 ms    <1 ms  10.20.2.150  3     *        *        *     Request timed out.  4     *        *        *     Request timed out.  5     *        *        *     Request timed out.  6     *        *        *     Request timed out.  7     *        *        *     Request timed out.  8     *        *        *     Request timed out. 9     *        *        *     Request timed out.10     *        *        *     Request timed out.11     *        *        *     Request timed out.12     *        *        *     Request timed out.13     *      531 ms     *     10.17.0.2914     *        *        *     Request timed out.15     *        *        *     Request timed out.16     *        *        *     Request timed out.17     *        *        *     Request timed out.18     *     1042 ms     *     10.17.0.2919     *        *        *     Request timed out.20     *        *        *     Request timed out.21     *        *        *     Request timed out.22     *        *        *     Request timed out.23     *        *      971 ms  10.17.0.29 10.17.0.29 is the VM I saw alerts raised for and was checking its reachability, there were other servers in that same subnet which would respond to ping with usual response times and without drops. I managed to resolve(mitigate as I am not sure of root cause) the issue by setting Prod interface in down state, committing change, and then binging the interface back online. As mentioned, this is running in Azure and Prod interface is configured to use User Defined Routing in order to allow for multiple subnets to be connected to same interface (This Prod at the moment only has 1 VM subnet attached).PA-VM - Eth1/1 - Prod: 10.17.4.254 with default pointing to 10.17.4.1 (This is the User Defined Routing). Then the 10.17.0.0/24 network has route to state default to point at 10.17.4.254. This is network I inherited and is more complex than what I managed to convey to you all, but the fact that I was having loop and odd one at that (I suspect that drops were down to TTL expired in transit and discarded by firewall) and that fix for this was a case of restarting network interface. We had seen similar issue on Dev interface some long time ago when the firewall was running 9.0.11 at the time and decided to upgrade to 9.0.14 to see if this was a bad update of some sort. We had raised case with Palo Alto support, but it was with no result, as we are not able to reproduce this issue request. I hope someone is able to shed some light as of what could be the cause of this.",0,"

I have setup and configured the Palo Alto VM series in Azure. Along with the management interface, the VM has “trust” and “untrust” interfaces. I have basically copied the rules over from our office Palo Alto devices, and my test VM is working great through the Palo Alto VM. However, I’m having a problem that I was wondering if you could help me out with. Here are the details: * The test VM is on a new subnet, but part of the same VNET. * I have a static route in the test subnet (in Azure) that basically forces all traffic destined for 0.0.0.0/0 to the trust interface on the Palo Alto VM. * The idea is for the Palo Alto VM to make all the traffic and routing decisions for IP addresses outside of the Azure VNETs. Addresses within the Azure VNET are handled automatically by Azure VNET routing. * No issues at all with websites and web services from the test VM. The Palo Alto VM is processing rules correctly from Trust to Untrust zones. * The issue is connecting back to resources on our corporate campus. * We have ExpressRoute between our office and Azure, and routes are advertised back to the office via BGP. * For other VMs and subnets in Azure (that are not going through the Palo Alto Azure VM), I have no problem connecting back to manage the office firewall or other services hosted out of the office. * I’ve setup a static route in the Palo Alto VM to route traffic intended for the office Palo Alto management IP addresses back through the Trust interface. * This should send the traffic back through Trust and through the VNET’s routing, which includes the route back to the office via ExpressRoute. * When I try to manage the NYC firewall, the connection times out. The office firewall log shows ""incomplete"" for application type. So, the traffic appears to be flowing from the Azure Palo Alto VM to the office Palo Alto, but I can't use it. * However, I can ping and traceroute back to the office firewall management interface. * I can also successfully ping and traceroute the test VM in Azure using the office's trust interface via the CLI. * I’m having the same problem with a service provider’s system that terminates out of our office. I can ping their services’ IP addresses, but I cannot connect to them using the web browser or application. I must be missing something relatively simple, but I’m not sure what it is. Since I’m routing from Palo Alto (VM) to physical Palo Alto (NYC), do I need some kind of rule on the PA in Azure to allow traffic back in? Any ideas? Thanks!",0,"

107,445252,VM-Series in the Public Cloud,birdperson,L0 Member,Public IPs with NAT in IPSEC,"I've got a rather bizarre setup that I'm trying to integrate with a new customer using a vm-series 300 in AWS. I have setup and established an IPSEC tunnel  (that even comes up when we attempt to send traffic over the tunnel). Where it gets complicated is that their expectation is that we NAT all traffic using public IPs and send the traffic through the tunnel (I should mention that the other side is a Cisco ASA device).  I've attached a fairly simple diagram of the setup that's been proposed by the customer on the other side ( IP addresses changed for safety). To sum it up quickly:  * we have a tunnel established between 1.1.1.1 and 2.2.2.2, this tunnel comes up when I attempt to send traffic through it* I've routed both 3.3.3.3/32 (our side of the nat translation) and 4.4.4.4/30 (their side of the nat translation) into the tunnel interface* when i attempt to send traffic through the tunnel over port 443 (ex: curl https://10.0.0.2) from our server the tunnel comes up* i can also see in the traffic monitor that the NAT policy appears to be applying (I can see the 10.x addresses NAT'd to the 3.3.3.3 and 4.4.4.4) addresses respectively. The customer is reporting that no traffic is coming through on their side. When I try to use the packet capture tool on our side and filter based on interface (tunnel.1 in this case), then try to send traffic, I don't see any packets. Is there anyway to verify that traffic is indeed flowing over the tunnel?  I could also have done something really wrong here, but I'd expect that if the tunnel comes up, some traffic is attempting to be sent.    ",1,"

Source NAT to the firewall's private ip 10.10.0.4/5, destination to the actual resource in the subscriber VNET (no internal load balancer for the resource) 10.50.0.20. No port translation was used in these attempts. Firewall does destination NAT only, using the same three destinations listed above (public IP, fqdn, firewall's public-private IP) directly to the internal resource. I see hits coming in in packet captures from my test source, but never a translation or any return traffic. On the way back out - and here's where I may be missing something - the resource has a route in a UDR to point to the internal load balancer that has the firewall's private IPs as a backend. Frontend IP for examples sake is 10.10.0.21. I'm not sure if I should be using the 'floating ip' option or leave that disabled, and I'm wondering if the Azure public IPs should be associated with the untrusted interfaces of the firewalls in the VM configuration, or if they should not have public IPs attached. I'd be fine with using the public load balancer for all inbound/outbound traffic if that would correct the problem, or if I need to make any additional configuration changes anywhere to get the floating IP option working. It looked easier to do NAT with a floating IP, as you could skip source NAT, but I'm not sure where to assign the public IP in the firewall's configuration.  Do I assign the public IPs directly to the firewall's untrusted interface? A loopback? What should NAT look like with the floating IP option? Thanks in advance for any input.",0,"

They are in the same VPC, different subnets.

That last event has ""tls-session-disconnected"" which makes me think maybe this is cert based (?) Does anyone know what may cause this behavior? We are brand new to palo, so thinking it may very well be a layer 8 thing, just stumped as to what. Thanks for the help! UPDATE: Looks like maybe this is a bug with 10.0.7///downgraded to 10.0.6 and it's connected now. UPDATE 2: This looks to maybe be a code bug...I downgraded both panorama and the FW to 10.0.6. and everything started to work.",0,"

This is happening in Azure internal communication as well as Azure to on-premise communication.

The user has to pick their own user certificate at least once and the computer certificate at least once before it goes away forever. This is strange since we know pre-login is working so GlobalProtect must somehow be automatically picking a certificate on its own.

I have everything set up with 4 Palo VM instances between an external and internal load balancer.  I am having an issue with NAT where traffic from the outside will not route to my internal VNETs unless it is first Source NATed to the internal interfaces of the firewalls. The source IP needs to be retained for security reasons on the proxy and with it only logging the internal interfaces of the firewalls I cannot implement proper policy. When I set the source NAT to ""none"" I can see the sessions on the firewall and they show that the traffic is doing exactly what it should but nothing ever reaches the proxy. We have even gone as far as to move the proxy to the same subnet as the internal interfaces of the firewall. I am not sure if I am running up against some asymetrical routing or something else. Any help with this would be greatly appreciated. Thanks in advance.  ",0,"

So please excuse me if this is a dumb question 🙂 I have been reading the design guides from Palo and that leads to this question. As per the docs, we use a public load balancer to accept traffic from the internet and the firewall will destination NAT it to inside VMs. So the load balancer will get an Azure public IP. Any traffic that comes to that IP will be eventually routed to inside VM as per the NAT rules. But what if we have 100s of the different web application that needs access from the internet? Do we still have that one public IP assigned to the load balancer?  As an example, I am hosting 10 different web services and each needs access from outside. Which public IP will those different web service URLs will point to?   ",0,"

I created a new instance in the same subnet and it has no outbound internet connection. Is anyone able to advise if I've missed a step? Do I need to?1. Add sub interfaces on the Palo Alto firewalls for the GWLB traffic and associate with the GWLB endpoints?2. Add another interface? I just have the management interface and one extra interface at the moment (ethernet1/1).

We deployed the ASG using Template 3.0 - all successful.2. Firewalls bootstrapped successfully.3. The lambda had a problem enabling the VM-Series element for cloudwatch (stated error 13 in use but) managed to make the change manually4. Everything else error free We are coming out of the firewall VPC and hitting the Panorama box in another VPC on it's external address. This never seems to complete the registration process and panorama status is disconnected. Things I've tried:1. Checked the ports2. Validated the bootstrap auth code (works fine and bootstrap is clear)3. Lowered the MTU on interface 1/1 to 14004. Manually registered a firewall in Panorama with the serial number and generated a manual auth code.5. Used that auth code on one of the firewalls to connect to Panorama. The auth code is accepted but still states disconnected on the firewall and in Panorama. It's really tough to get any detailed diagnosis for the error. Did I miss something? We are running version 10.1.0 on the firewalls and in Panorama. Would really appreciate a steer if anyone has faced this issue.  ",0,"

Heres a post from that discussion: In our reference architecture and companion deployment guide, we do not typically recommend terminating the VPNs on the Virtual Appliance running in Azure.  This is b/c you will need to use SNAT to enforce return path routing through the proper firewall to prevent asymmetric routing as we cannot extend BGP from the firewalls to the Azure Route Table.  Instead, you may consider terminating the VPN on the Azure VPN Gateway and use our backhaul routing design to force all traffic to and from the Gateway subnet through the firewall utilizing UDRs and the Load Balancer.",0,"

I'm looking for suggestions to minimize headaches and work. The existing VMs are deployed as a firewall on a stick with a single management interface and public facing interface. The public facing interface terminates VPNs from several spoke VPCs as well as VPNs to two offices. Those two offices are the transit paths for close to 30 other locations. The management interface is neutered, only being used for Palo updates via a NAT gateway. All other management traffic / services use a loopback interface. Routing is all BGP. Panorama is pushing some basic device templates. I've attached a sketch showing the current state and finished state. Here are the reasons for the rebuilds: Now need Palo HA for some public facing services. HA requires eth1/1 as HA2. Currently eth1/1 is the public facing interface and handles all data plane trafficMoving on-prem access from Palo VPNs to Cisco DMVPN to reduce latency and improve the user experience. All ~30 offices are already using Cisco DMVPN for WAN access. Making these AWS tenants DMVPN spokes will improve access for everyone.Current Palo management access rides in the firewall data planeI'm planning to stand up new m5.xlarge instances with four interfaces, mapping eth0-eth4 as mgmt, eth1/1 (ha2), eth1/2 (public), and eth1/3 (private).

First the AMI was old, so I updated that to 9.1, now it's created one PA in the transit VPC, but I can't login (password is wrong) so I'm guessing the bootstrap config (which I am just using the one in this git) is maybe not working for 9.1 as it says 8.0 in the xml. Or I'm fine doing things manually, I just don't get the transit VPC portion. I had one setup with just a peer link and I could ping between the VPCs, but internet traffic would not flow through the Palo. What I found was it looks like that's not a supported model and you have to do IPSEC tunnels? I'm getting a bit turned around there, I just want my outbound traffic from a subscribing VPC to flow through the Palo for outbound traffic. ",0,"

I really would like to avoid to install  these content packages manually and automate the deployment as much as possible. I would also like to have my default shared policies containing these EDLs pushed to these firewalls right after they have been deployed.I tried to put the content update packages directly in the /content folder in my S3 bootstrap bucket, but it looks like the Firewall does not see them and never installs them during the bootstrap process. I made sure the files have the correct name and downloaded these content files from the Palo Alto support center before uploading them to my S3 bucket.Please note that during my tests I was using PAYG VM-300 Bundle 2 instances, version 9.0.9-h1.xfr Did someone manage to make this work somehow?Any help would be greatly appreciated 🙂Thanks.Yann         ",0,"

NAT rule assistance.,"Howdy Group. I have a newbie question and wanted to ask the group. Maybe I am thinking too hard about it.Customer wanted a FW load balancer on both sides… and this was the screen capture of the solution.   I have a nice easy question about incoming traffic and how it gets to its proper destination. My question is surrounding NAT and the need to use it. In a traditional FW, a session is created with a SA/DA pair, that hits the public interface of a FW, and the NAT rules show how the traffic will be evaluated and forwarded. But my experience in Azure and with LB, and how traffic gets from point A to point B is confusing me. Lets say… I have a web server at www.my company.com, that resolves to a public IP of 140.242.125.50 (some made up IP) How does the traffic session get created.  Walk me through the setup.  What is doing the NAT, to get to the private server IP, where the server resides in Azure, on the internal LB. Confusing pieces for me in Azure (limited experience).  You can bind a public IP to a private IP (just like you manage the FW).So, in this case, Azure “magic” knows when I hit the public IP of my FW, to send traffic to the mgmt. IP.  This is perfect and makes sense. Now… company.com goes to the public IP as I described above.My customer believes the external LB will forward the request to the nic-1 of the FW (or in my case 10.5.30.4).We set up NAT rule to fwd traffic hitting 10.5.30.4:443 to internal server of 10.5.1.4 (DG of 10.5.1.1 or what I call the Azure magic IP)Traffic failed.  Quite simply… as I understood it… my NAT rule did not translate my original src IP of 10.5.30.6 (test computer).When the 10.5.1.4 server saw that the SA was on a different subnet, it fwd to its default gateway, and 10.5.1.1 fwd the packet (around the FW)… Azure magic.. asymmetric routing.I did a DNAT where I did both a SNAT and a DNAT, so the traffic would respond back to my FW internal IP of 10.5.30.4, and the return traffic worked, and all is good. But… it gets away from how/IF/why do I need a NAT rule (according to the customer) My customer really thinks the external LB will fwd traffic to the backend pool (the nic-1 of either FW) and then the FW should have logic (NAT rule) to fwd it through the FW.But I cannot get my head around… in Azure, not every single packet (from a public FQDN) would have a private IP of the PANW FW nic-1. I am missing the logic of how we get the NAT rule defined. To add complexity (maybe not….lol) is that I am using Panorama to manage both FWs, so now I have 2 devices in the same device group, with different IPs for nic-1… but…. Same NAT policy statement.So, for example… if my nic-1 is 10.50.30.4 and 30.5, then this is how my NAT policy looks.    If my FW could be in Vwire mode, (which is what I think the customer believes.) then traffic from the external LB is fwd to the nic-1, which would automatically fwd to nic-2, which would fwd to the internal LB, to get to the web server in the backend pool.But… that is not how it is… and I cannot find documentation (or have experience) on how it should be setup. Please help.  😝 ",0,"

283,333993,VM-Series in the Public Cloud,JimMcGrady,L3 Networker,Routing public websites via Palo in Azure?,"I have a pair of VM-300 in a load balancer sandwich configuration in Azure. An internal load balancer is on the inside and handles outbound traffic. An external load balancer is on the outside and is intended for inbound traffic from internet.  I can assign a public IP as the front end of the external load balancer. My first question - can a single external load balancer have multiple public IP front ends defined? My second question concerns how traffic flows from an internet client to one of my backend servers. This is my understanding - please correct me if i am wrong: The external interface of each of the two firewalls resides on a privately addressed subnet. Example: 10.1.1.0/24 with fw1 being 10.1.1.4 and fw2 being 10.1.1.5. Each firewall has a default route to internet via Azure gw ip 10.1.1.1 The frontend of the ELB has a publicIP 13.75.1.1 described as 'webserver1'. It has a backend pool called webserver1-pool. The real backend webserver is 10.2.2.10. But that is not directly reachable from the LB. And we want the traffic to route via the firewalls. If i want the LB to forward traffic via the vm-300 pair, then the backend pool members would have to be addresses on subnet 10.1.1.0/24 yes? fw1 could have a secondary IP of 10.1.1.11 associated with its external interface. It would then have a nat rule such that traffic destined for 10.1.1.11 is destination natted to go to 10.2.2.10.Similarly, fw2 could have a secondary IP of 10.1.1.12 associated with its external interface. It would then have a nat rule such that traffic destined for 10.1.1.12 is destination natted to go to 10.2.2.10.Therefore the backend pool defined on the ELB would have members webserver1a 10.1.1.11 and webserver1b 10.1.1.12 Would each firewall also have to source NAT the traffic so the real server's replies path correctly? Or will that just work?Is there a cleaner way of doing this? having multiple NATs is a pain.  having to use the firewall's external interface subnet for all NATs is also awkward. ",0,"

The VM-Series would be used for egress traffic only, and we dont have tight SLA's so ideally a single VM FW will sort us out. If I deploy a single VM-Series into say Availability Zone-1B, and some other hosts are also in the same AZ, now I can route all my traffic to the VM-Series FW and egress out to the web. All happy. If I do the same have a VM-Series in 1B, but have some clients in AZ-1C, they cannot route out to the internet. I can see the traffic is hitting the firewall on the Monitor tab of the Firewall, but that is about as far as it gets. Is there some horrible limitation where these firewalls can only route traffic if they are in the same AZ as the client? With the Sophos UTM this has never been an issue before, whatever you point at it from whatever location it will just route out to the web.  Of course could be I am doing something really stupid as well 🙂",0,"

After the deployment, the ALB (ELBv2) Target Group Health Checks fail and I noticed that there is no process opening port 81 on the FW, even after the management interface switch - https://docs.paloaltonetworks.com/vm-series/7-1/vm-series-deployment/set-up-the-vm-series-firewall-i...2. How do we debug this web ui or web portal for Firewall?3. Is that the expected behavior to expose on port 80 on frontend? Is this to simulate a simple scenario with the cfn templates and we need to manually setup certificates on ALB for communication over TLS?4. How do we configure multiple authcodes in the bootstrap package, assuming 2 FWs, 1 per AZ?  Thanks ",0,"

402,238287,VM-Series in the Public Cloud,JD-SECD,L1 Bithead,PANOS is not able to see the public IP of a client in the Traffic Logs if using an AWS Public ALB,"Hello, I've been trying to get past what seems to be a shortfall of the AWS ALB and PANOS alike. Please let me build you my current issue. I am trying to set up a ""loadbalance sandwich"" such that a public AWS ALB will be load balancing between two PANW firewalls (different AZs), and then the firewall will pass traffic to an internal AWS ALB. The main sticking point is how can we keep the source IP address of the client/requester in the PANOS Traffic Logs. I understand that the ALBs can send x-forward-for headers to the PANOS. The sad thing with this is that the only way to see the xff header in the PANOS is via URL logs. In that case you would then need the firewalls to have URL subscriptions. This seems very clunky and not very helpful to manually correlate URL Logs with Traffic Logs, not to mention extra cost for the subs. Someone from the PANW PS team said that the source ip address can be saved/passed to the PANOS if we register the Public ALBs Targets as instances instead of registering targets via ip (see below for more helpful “gotchas”). In short this did not work – I can only seeing the private ip address of the Public ALB. The only way I have found to maintain the public IP of the client/request in the PANOS’ traffic logs is to remove the Public ALB, use Route53 (AWS DNS service) to load balance (via a public hosted zone with the DNS A records to have Routing Policy either equal weights or primary/secondary failover) and healthcheck the firewalls. This leads to local dns caching shortfalls and TTL considerations. Can anyone on this discussion board help with my issue? I have a case opened with AWS and PANW, I am hoping to get a quicker and more creative solution via this forum. If anyone reads this post, many thanks for your time in reading – I hope it makes sense. Any feedback helps.   __________________________________________________________________________start of: Registering PANW firewalls as instances of a ALB Target group If you are going to configure the Public ALBs to target instances, you have to do a little more work.Since the ALB's only send traffic to the eth0 of the EC2 instance and most PANW firewalls will have eth0 as MGMT and eth1 as eth1/1 we have to swap interfaces. It took me a while to get my head around the concept, but eventually I got it to swap correctly. To get past this swap/shortfall you MUST ensure both MGMT and eth1/1 are DHCP clients  then you have to swap interfaces via this article (https://www.paloaltonetworks.com/documentation/71/virtualization/virtualization/set-up-the-vm-series...). I then wanted to get the MGMT and eth1/1 subnets back to “normal” (see below table for a little bit of clarification).I had to create an AWS AMI image, launch a new instance from that AMI image and on the configuration options page of the instance I had ensure I used the untrust-subnet as the primary and add the secondary NIC associated with the MGMT-subnet.*** NOTE when creating an AMI image this will reboot the firewall that the AWS AMI image is copying from.*** NOTE when you launch from an AMI image the admin account sometimes get corrupted so you have to create a new user and assign that user superuser permission from the cli of the newly created AMI firewall instance in order to get access to the GUI via elastic ip. See below for an example of my subnet:Private IP association: BEFORE SWAP oninbound-fw-aAFTER SWAP oninbound-fw-aAFTER AMI oninbound-fw-a-amiMgmt10.0.0.1010.0.1.1010.0.0.63Untrust10.0.1.1010.0.0.1010.0.1.63  Private IP association: BEFORE SWAP oninbound-fw-bAFTER SWAP oninbound-fw-bAFTER AMI oninbound-fw-b-amiMGMT10.0.10.1010.0.20.1010.0.10.154Untrust10.0.20.1010.0.10.1010.0.20.37  end of: Registering PANW firewalls as instances of a ALB Target group ___________________________________________________________________________________ ",0,"

We have UDRs setup for all 3 interfaces as well as a UDR setup for the other subnets. The plan is to push all traffic in, out, and between subnets through this single Palo unit.  We have 2 virtual routers built out; 1 for trusted, and 1 for untrusted interface. Trusted VR receives traffic internal and pushes internet traffic to the Untrust VR, and all traffic meant for subnet cross traffic is supposed to be forwarded to the Trust interface gateway and then should get to the correct subnet (barring any rules).  What we see is when trying a ping; the icmp is allowed through the rules, but then ages out so no reply back from the second VM. I believe there's an issue in these VRs but I can't seem to track it down. I've seen a lot of docs showing that Palo can be run in 1 vnet/multiple subnets with 1 interface but not really sure how this works. My only other FW experience is SonicWall so 1 port 1 zone makes sense but the 1 port many zones sure doesn't. Anyone know what to look for in either the Palo or Azure? I'm really not even sure the Azure UDRs are correct but everything I've read points to them being right (Palo documentation and online forums) so really I'm kinda at a brick wall on where to go next.

The standard SKU has better functionality and the recommendations is to use it in all new deployments. I had a project to deploy firewalls in Azure with standard SKU external load balancers. Everything seemed fine for internal traffic and outbound traffic, however inbound Internet traffic was not working and I could not see any packets arriving on the external interfaces. In this project a third party company was responsible for the Azure configuration and they kept on claiming that the problem was with the firewall configuration and that nothing is blocking traffic in Azure because there were “no NSGs” applied. After wasting almost a day in troubleshooting and after re-creating the issue in my own environment, I discovered that the NSG behaviour has changed in Standard SKU and even the Azure experts were not aware of that. Previously not having an NSG meant “all traffic allowed”. Now in Standard SKU all inbound to the Standard SKU resources (Public IPs and Public Load Balancers) is blocked by default, unless explicitly allowed by a NSG. It is a small detail and is in fact mentioned in the Azure documentation, but it is easy to miss and being aware of it can save you valuable time troubleshooting. “Communication with a standard SKU resource fails until you create and associate a network security group and explicitly allow the desired inbound traffic.”https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/virtual-network/virtual-network-ip-addresses-overview-arm  ",1,"

Is there another way to get this done? After we (finally, after several tries) got a CF stack to complete successfully, we could never connect to our jump box. We would rather put an elastic IP on the MGMT interfaces and get the firewalls configured - then configured access through the firewalls to the jump box.

Internally, by creating a CNAME entry with the FQDN for the ELB, the load balancer forwards to each of the AD FS servers as it should. I have the necessary NAT and security policies as well as policy based forwarding rule as this is the 2nd public interface with forwarding traffic. Public traffic gets forwarded fine to the ELB, as long as the IP address I enter in the destination translation of the NAT policy is set explicitly is current. All of the other references to the ELB can be a FQDN, but since this parameter needs to be an IP, this won't work very long without manually changing this IP as the private IP of the ELB changes frequently. I don't want to change to an external ELB as that would require I use seperate external interfaces on the Palo VM-300, which are precious to us. I don't want to use a 3rd party load balancer as this would complicate monitoring and may not work if we want to implement auto-scaling for this or other projects in the future.

I had a session with Palo support where I was told that the destination translation needs to be an IP so what I was trying to do wouldn't work, but I wasn't clear whether or not what I want to do at a high level is possible using some other method that I am not aware of.

I've set up 2 interfaces each with their own EIPs and attached them to the VM-300. Traffic flows properly to the first server and the IPsec tunnels work through the first interface. Setting up the 2nd public interface with the same settings as the first and creating the necessary security and NAT policies to allow traffic to flow to the 2nd server shows incoming traffic going to that interface's private IP, but the traffic ages out. If I restart the instance, none of the traffic makes it to either server and the IPsec tunnels will not come back up.",0,"

What happens though, is during their process they are forced to blow away their EC2 instance and create a new one. AWS then assigns new public IPs to them. Is there any way for us to pull that information in and have our PANs update dynamically for the IPsec peer address? Right now we manually update them which is very time consuimg.  The only thing I've thought of but haven't explore too much assigning each vpn tunnel a DNS record and having an external vendor or AWS provide the updated IP, using FQDN on our PANs. ",0,"

It seems to be that you simply need to set a valid bootstrap config and it should take, however that is not working. It seems to be that the config took (we are setting IP statically on mgmt port) but the password configuration is not working. Anyone have any insight/suggestions?",0,"

This VM cannot be downgraded.""  So it appears I'm forced to deploy 8.0?  I don't know about you guys, but I hate going to a new major revision without at least a couple maintenace releases out.  Also, this is going to go in our Panorama, and I certainly don't want to upgrade our Panorama to 8.0 yet. Am I stuck with 8.0? ",0,"
