0,508078,Astardzhiev,"Hi @LeonardoMachado ,I haven't personally tested (and at the moment I don't have the resources to do it), but I believe you should be able to have separe Decryption rules and applying different certificate.As you know Decryption policies/rule are working pretty much like normal firewall rule - firewall evaluating the rules top to bottom search for first match based on given information - source/dest IP, dest port, and custom URL category.I would assume that you can do the following:- Let say we have three servers behind the reverse proxy - a.example.com, b.example.com and c.example.com- Create three SSL decryption rules matching destination IP the public IP of the reverse proxy (before the NAT)- For each rule define dedicate custom URL category that will match only the FQDN for the specific site - (one URL category for ""a.example.com/"", one url category for ""b.example.com/"" and one url category for ""c.example.com/"")I am imagine that when inbound connection is received it will probably match the first decryption rule (based on destination IP). When client send the ""Client Hello"" message during SSL negotiation, firewall will use the SNI to identify the actual requested URL and will use it as URL category match, which will trigger new policy evaluation and with the new information it should match only the one with the correct custom URL category and reply to the custmer with the corresponding certificate.But as I mentioned, this is what would expect to happen, but not able to confirm. So it will be intersting if you have any way to test it and share the results.Another approach - simpler but costlier - consider the use of wildcard certificate. In this case you can have single decryption rule (without the need of URL category, only dest ip and port) applying certificate *.example.com. So no matter which of the three services the user is requesting they will receive the same wildcard certificate.The advantage of this approach is that it simplies your certificate management - you only need to renew single certificate and you don't have to make any changes on the FW when introducing new services behind the proxyThe disadvantage is that wildcard certificate could cost more.",1,07-07-2022,05:01 AM
1,508078,LeonardoMachado,"I'll try to use the SNI field from the TSL Hello Package to create a new application. Then, I will use this new ""application"" to differentiate traffic and create a specific decrypt policy.I'll let you know if it works.Thank you.",1,07-08-2022,05:55 AM
2,508078,Astardzhiev,"Hey @LeonardoMachado ,Defining custom application using the SNI is actually really great idea. It should have the same effect as using default ssl application and custom URL, but this probably will provide better overview.Just don't forget to add the custom applications to the allow security rule.I am interested in the final result, keep us posted.",1,07-09-2022,07:24 AM
3,508078,LeonardoMachado,This solution to segregate the inbound traffic using a custom application based on do SNI field of the TSL Client Hello cannot be configured.The Decryption Policy configuration window does not have the Application tab which would allow me to specify only the newly created application to be decrypted. I wonder why PA does not allow decryption policies to be further limited to specific inbound applications.,0,07-12-2022,07:15 AM
4,508078,LeonardoMachado,The solution is quite easy: Decryption Policy accepts URL Category. I have created a custom category with my URL and voilà!! No application needed.THnks!,0,07-12-2022,02:52 PM
5,508282,Adrian_Jensen,"""dns-base"" is one of the subsets of the ""dns"" application ID. The ""dns"" application ID is currently being split into to separate subcategories so those who want can filter non-compliant DNS requests: dns-base: general DNS requests dns-non-rfc: Non-RFC complaint DNS requestsYou can see the descriptions of these application IDs on your PaloAlto under: Objects -> Applications -> search ""dns"" and then click the dns application namesdns-non-rfc was introduced June 21 2022 and is scheduled for activation July 19 2022. You can read more here:https://live.paloaltonetworks.com/t5/customer-resources/dns-app-id-enhancement-release-plan/ta-p/487...If your current Security Policies allow application ID ""dns"", that will include both subsets. If you only want to allow RFC compliant DNS traffic, then your Security Policy should only allow ""dns-base"" (non-RFC compliant will be excluded after July 19).Since your current Security Policy set is denying DNS traffic, I would start looking at your current rule to allow ""dns"" or ""dns-base"". Is it applied to the correct zones, source/destination addresses, and using ""application default"" or ""any"" Service?IMPORTANT EDIT: Re-reading the enhancement release now, there are recent comments that people using ""dns"" application ID had their Security Policy broken, they had to explicitly add the subset ""dns-base"" to get DNS working again.

I have seen the update intervals change over the years, getting smaller as PANW increases their frequency of providing updates.For my NGFWs, I always load the Day 1 Configuration 1st. It includes the current best practice update schedule for each update. https://knowledgebase.paloaltonetworks.com/KCSArticleDetail?id=kA10g000000PM2lCAG It also includes many other best practices.

13,507647,Astardzhiev,"Hi @Mohanlalsaini ,What PanOS version are you running? Are you sure that destination network should be reachable through different interface/zone",0,07-07-2022,05:18 AM
14,507446,Astardzhiev,"Hi @Abhishekrs987 ,I am almost certain that the problem is caused by the FQDN object. More specifically the FQDN you are trying to reach is using DNS loadbalaning which will return differen IPs every few requests.What (most probably) is happening is that:- By default firewall is making DNS request every 30mins to resolve the FQDN object used in the policy. When it receive reply it will cache all the IPs and use them in the policy (for the next 30mins). After 30mins it will repeat the process and if it receives different IPs it will replace them in the allow rule.- Every time user tries to reach the FQDN it will make new DNS request (of course it will cache the reply, but untill the TTL expires).One way you can try to solve this is to tell the firewall to use the TTL in the DNS response. This will have benefit for FQDNs with short TTL. The problem is it could bring additional load to the management plane (it will force the firewall to make additional DNS queries and constantly updating the policy).Unfortunately I am not sure that will help agains DNS round robin load balancing, where almost every DNS request receive different reply. I think I have seen such with some Office365 or Azure services....cannot remember specific exmaple right now.",0,07-01-2022,12:42 AM
15,507446,Abhishekrs987,"Hi @Astardzhiev,Thanks for the response. It is very informative.But the fqdn which i created is tools1.cisco.com, when i tried resolving it everytime it resolves to a single IP and even in the logs for both the deny and allow logs i am seeing same ip in the destination",0,07-06-2022,11:11 PM
16,507446,Astardzhiev,"Hi @Abhishekrs987 ,Interesting...I can see this FQDN also has very long TTL. Are you able to provide screenshot from your rule and from defailed log view (magnifing glass on the far left of the log entry) for both allowed and denied traffic. Feel free to obfuscate any sensitive information (IP addresses, source users, zone names)I just re-read your question - as mentioned here - https://docs.paloaltonetworks.com/pan-os/9-1/pan-os-admin/monitoring/use-syslog-for-monitoring/syslo...Action Source will specificy where the final action was defined by the rule or by the application. It should be normal to see ""from-application"" when traffic is blocked. This is because each application definition has ""deny action"", which will tell the firewall how what to do when it denies the traffic. This is important, because some applications are sensitive and when connection is denied, FW needs to send TCP RST or the connection will stall on either the client or the server.I am intersted to see the ""Session End Reason"" log field for both allowed and blocked traffic.",0,07-07-2022,01:31 AM
17,507307,Astardzhiev,"Hi @Sly_Cooper ,I am guessing you mean if application is used pinned certificate, not the site.Pinned certificate means that the application which is initiating the traffic and trying to reach the public server has some additional check and expect the server to reply with specific certificate, or at least with cert that is signed only by specific CA.Unfortunately if it is not explicetly mentioned in the application documentation the only way is to try it.Try to use the application with decryption enabled, if there is a problem, try to disable the decryption, if it works add it as permanent exception.",0,07-01-2022,12:48 AM
18,507218,SutareMayur,"Hi@Ramakrishnan,For the policies if traffic log at session START is enabled, there are chances that the logs will show matching incorrect policy. This is because, when request reaches the firewall interface, the first matching policy in the set will be matched to allow traffic and create session but still at backend, firewall is checking for matching the security profile configurations. So the logs at session END will show the correct rules once all the checks are done by the firewall. Kindly refer this article for more details.Coming to your 2nd query that you are not able to see logs under URL filtering tabs. To view the logs, you need to make sure that URL category action is set to alert to log the URL filtering logs.Hope it helps!",0,06-30-2022,01:57 AM
19,439841,BPry,"@KMcKenna,I think this was actually throughout the United States (at least), and I was personally pretty upset to be woken up due to a critical alert being thrown that is no where near critical in functionality. The fact that the device-telemetry is failing to send isn't a concern, and I wouldn't worry about the warning.If you have system log settings enabled that email you critical alerts, you can add 'and not (subtype eq device-telemetry)' to your filter to stop getting alerts for telemetry events.",3,10-09-2021,07:51 PM
20,439841,KMcKenna,"@BPryThanks for commenting. I heard back from Support. The suggested that the issue is the region as it exists in the config, is causing the error. Support posted the following information.Also, you can run the command ""show device-telemetry settings"" and check what region it is showing, and if the region name is shown all in lower case format, we will need to modify it as it is case-sensitive. In your case, I see it says ""americas"" all in lower case, therefore we would need to change this setting through CLI.Please use the below commands to modify the region name:> configure#set deviceconfig system device-telemetry region Americas#commitSo what appeared to resolve this so far on one PA-820 was disabling Telemetry and committing. Then re-enabling Telemetry, Committing... Then setting the region with a capital A and committing again. It's not clear that this exact process is needed. But I had tried setting the regain names as directed while Telemetry was active and failing. Then committing. But the uipload continued to fail. So I waited for another cycle. Saw the same failure and tried this and the telemetry upload was successful on the PA-820 and it's HA paired device.I just tried the same process on a VM Series. Waiting for status as I believe this is a 2 or 4 hours cycle. I'll post results.As to why this became an issue on Oct 8th, I do not know. We made no changes. No commits. No OS upgrade. I suspect the change may have been made on Palo Alto's side. We are running 10.0.5 and planning to update the OS to 10.0.6 next weekend. Possibly the region names in 10.0.5 and earlier are not compliant.That's what I know. I hope it helps. I realize telemetry function isn't critical. But as you wrote, the critical alerts are annoying.Thnx again",3,10-10-2021,05:55 PM

I suspect this may be related to the version of PAN-OS we are running (10.0.5) or possibly the platforms but we do have three different Strata platforms in service.So enabling Telemetry, committing, then editing the Region in the CLI and committing again (waiting for commit and HA sync to complete) resolved the issue for us.Hope this helps.",0,10-12-2021,07:05 AM

28,504520,Adrian_Jensen,"Not seeing the images, you put them on OneDrive or something... need to post them here.By default, the intrazone-default and interzone-default rules do not log traffic. Select each from the Security rule list and then click the ""Override"" button in the bottom task bar and you can then enable logging on the rule. You may also want to enable both start and end logging for the defaults and your special rule. The 2 Traffic log entries may then tell you something about the traffic being identified initially under one rule and then being reclassified to a different rule later.It is important to remember that the PA doesn't work on top-down processing like a traditional firewall, it works on most-specific-match processing.

51,480538,mfalconer,"If you use the PA as a CA, then you'll have to export the root certificate from the PA and import on any client that will need to trust certificates it issues.For example, if you use a self-signed cert for decryption and the endpoints don't have the root certificate in their trust store, you'll get a warning in the browser.Same problem if you use it on a public facing service, browsers won't trust the authority that issued the certificate and they'll get a warning message.Common practice is to keep the root authority offline or powered-down to avoid compromise. An intermediate authority is created that actually issues and revokes the certificates.Do you have an internal private authority that your clients already trust, like a Microsoft CA?For external services that the general public needs to access, you can get a free cert with a short expiration or pay a couple of hundred dollars for 1-year.

I understand that running an internal PKI is fraught with security risks and should be avoided unless there's an experienced team to manage it. Should I reconsider this?3) If I continue using self signed certs, then I'm back to my original question: Should I use a bunch of root-cert/end-cert chains for each service on the firewall (thus meaning I may have 4 or 5 chains, with 4-5 individual root certs, for various firewall services) , or should I use one root cert, and have a bunch of end certs signed by that one single root cert, for all firewall services?

The symptoms are as follows:Our pingdom test to our OWA website shows as down (i.e. the web page hosted behind the firewall cannot be reached from the internet)Users connected via GlobalProtect experience either horrible performance or outright disconnects.GP connected users running ping tests to internal resources show 10-60+% packet loss. (it varies widely)Users connected in the data center running ping tests to ISP gateway show similar packet loss patterns and experience horrible performance / no connection to the internet.This condition lasts 1-20+ minutes and is obviously causing major headaches.I've opened a TAC case, but as seems to be the case as of late, the wait times to talk to a human are long.We have an HA pair in an active/passive setup at the data center and I've failed over with no apparent change in this condition. I've also removed the in-line switch (that takes the one physical connection from our ISP and splits it to the HA pair) from the equation with no change in the condition.I can't MAKE it happen, but it has been happening regularly enough to be a real thorn in our side.I haven't seen anything in the system log that I recognize as being relevant to this behavior.I upgraded the pair to PAN-OS 10.0.8-h8 in the hopes I'd tripped an obscure bug and the update would fix it. Sadly it did not.If anyone as ideas, I am wide open to them.It may make sense to also change the MSS on the firewall in order to keep TCP packets small enough to avoid fragmentation. If you have dropped the MTU down to 1492 an MSS of the default of 1380 (which i see has been changed in the configuration for some reason) should help keep TCP in check as well. You can set this value with the command 'sysopt connection tcpmss 1380'. 1380 would leave 112 bytes available for headers etc (1492-1380).",0,02-15-2022,01:47 AM

But if GP users are having issue, it should be the outside connection having problems.My humbple opinion is to first confirm that the packets are indeed reaching the firewall, if they are only then to dig deeper into debugging the firewall.Meanwhile you can check some trivial stuff:- Physical interface on the firewalls to outside switch for errors- Switch to ISP CPE interfaces for errors.",0,02-15-2022,09:22 AM

But we have had a few other pieces of information come to the forefront.The following is true regardless of which firewall is active out of the HA pair. They behave the same.If we ping from the outside interface to the ISP gateway, we get duplicate packets and dropped packets.If we ping from the inside interface to the next hop switch, we get dropped packets and no duplicates.For both the above pings the latency averages between 100 and 250 ms!Pings from the next hop switch to anywhere else in our network average in the sub 10ms range.The duplicate packets from the ISP speak to something there, but the high latency on all pings throws concern on the firewall itself.I feel like I'm missing something basic, but don't know what it is.

When we narrowed it down, we discovered virtually all the traffic was coming from our HQ's default internet IP!?Turns out, that for some still unknown reason, clients that brought their computers back into the office and left their GlobalProtect client enabled - even if they didn't authenticate - were the ones causing the issue.More specifically, a single client could, in essence, DDoS the Colo firewall with the number of packets it was sending out. The common element was a zoom meeting on a client whose GP software was either connected or trying to connect.We ended up creating a block rule on the HQ firewall to prevent the GP clients from reaching the Colo firewall while in the office.

68,461787,SteveCantwell,"HelloSo, what does ""aged out"" mean in the session termination reason?It means that the FW opened a session for Client and Server to talk, and for whatever reason, either Client or Server stopped communication. The default session timer is 3600 secs (so for up to 1 hour, remote side stopped transmitting/return vpn traffic to your FW) Your firewall CANNOT cause these two devices to stop talking, unless there is security policy, security profile, threat, DoS, Zone Protection, etc type of security restriction to END the session. This is not what you are seeing.As you correctly stated.. you see ENCAPSULATION occurring but NO DECAP. So we cannot decap traffic that we are not receiving.By tearing the VPN down and restarting it, you are clearing out the SPI session from the VPN, ideally from both sides, and negotiating again. So, if you look at traffic logs (and bring up the column headers for Packets, Packets Sent, Packets Recevied) you should be able to correctly determine/confirm that the FW is egressing packets out, towards the remote side, but getting zero returns. If true, then can the FW stop the remote side from transmitting it packets? I ask again... can your FW actually STOP the OTHER side from transmitting their packets? The answer is NO. Now, your FW CAN stop receiving their packets, and this is called a security policy., right?So, if you have traffic leaving your FW and zero packets recieved by FW from the remote side, you have a ISP/remote network issue that would need to be troubleshoot.

111,379451,aper,hi @FWPalolearneryes absolutely you can enable all the security profiles on your port based rulesthe content engines are smart enough to detect for themselves which protocols they can and will scan so they can be applied to anything from any any to fully set app + app-default rules and will function as expectedthere is no concept of 'overscanning' like some legacy firewalls (eg. smtp signatures will not be matched if the content engine detects http) so it is perfectly safe to enable _everything_ on all rules even if there are no applicationshope this helps,0,01-13-2021,05:11 AM

115,206821,ssghanim,No I only could not find these answers. As you know I could try the test until I am good with passing the test but I would like to know the answer since I am taking the FREE course but this question I was not able to find it anywhere watching and reading the training material. I knew the ansser but I was not sure though.I apprecaite your prompt reply.,0,03-22-2018,06:19 PM
116,206821,ssghanim,Yes it did. I knew the answer I just needed to make sure I was correct. I am so pleased to see how many people wanted to help me. Also I will check when I am allowed to logon to the firewall. According to our corporate policy I am not allowed to log on to the firewall until I pass the test which now I am done and be able to monitor the firewall. All I needed is to be able to go to ACC and monitor users activities and see who is abusing the bandwdith.,1,03-22-2018,06:24 PM
117,206821,aper,congratulations on passing the test! 🙂,0,03-23-2018,01:41 AM
118,206821,ssghanim,Thank you too. Now my company is going to give me access to only monitor ACC network traffic to see how from our contract is using the bandwidth the most and who is abusing the internet. My contract is in Afghanistan and we have three location each have 1 PA-220 firewall. Corporate IT have all admin rights but will not allow me to log to the firewall until I pass the ACE. That is why I wanted to make sure I understand everything not just pass the test. Areas that interest me the most User-ID and monitoring and reporting.Have a great day.,0,03-23-2018,03:10 AM
