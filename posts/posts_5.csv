0,508975,Next-Generation Firewall Discussions,qdimclark,L2 Linker,Google Cloud VPN IKE-SA-INIT packets being dropped,"I built a site-to-site VPN between GCP and a PA3250, which is not working. Surely, I'm missing something. The GCP vpn points to the same interface and IP that other VPNs successfully use on the Palo. I added a Sec policy to allow the GCP IP and the Palo IP to set up Phase 1. However, the Palo drops the inbound IKE-SA-INIT packets. They are getting caught by the INTRAZONE Default rule. I've verified the IP addresses, the IKE paramters, the PSK, and the Sec policy. In fact I've rebuilt this a few times by completely deleting everything on the GCP side and the related configs in the Palo. To test I set up a VPN from the same GCP project to a different PA3250 with a different IP address and that tunnel works flawlessly. Everytime I've rebuilt the VPNs I get a different public IP from GCP. So, it's not an issue with their IP addresses. What appears to be happening, but I can't verify is that the PA3250 with the issue Policy Denies the packets and just drops all subsequent packets from that address. Like it's cached somewhere. As a test I deleted the VPN config from both sides before leaving yesterday. I created them from scratch this morning, about 14 hours later, with the same results. The first packet gets denied and nothing else. When I run test vpn ike-sa gateway ******** from the cli, a packet capture shows that the outbound packet from the Palo gets dropped. I've scoured both PA3250s for the difference, but only come up with the Palo IP address. Suggestions?",0,"

36,478072,Next-Generation Firewall Discussions,packetfarmer,L1 Bithead,"Looking to switch to PAN for NGFW, need insight into IPS, reporting and analytics, network visibility, etc","Hey all, I work IT security for a SMB in the financial sector and I'm looking into PAN, FortiGate and Check Point for a better NGFW solution than what we currently have, which is Sonicwall. For about 6 years we've been using an NSA 3600 to cover our main company network and then a TZ500 to connect back to the main branch via point to point VPN at a single remote branch. I also have a subscription to their Network Security Manager (NSM) (hosted) mainly for reporting and analytics. The base functionality of our Sonicwalls have been fine, and I like them for the most part. However, things like reporting, analytics, network visibility into traffic and threat events and more, are pretty sub-par. The Security Services technically work, but they work very poorly. Also, NSM doesn't even function properly despite months of working with support to get it working. The end result is that it is not meeting our needs with regards to perimeter network security monitoring and reporting. A while back, we had an IT vulnerability audit and pen test, which resulted in a finding that basically displayed that our Sonicwall's IDS/IPS/Security Services were not adequately reporting on external port scans and intrusion attempts. The auditor did an aggressive scan with nmap (among other things), and I was simply unable to spot the scan and report it back to them. Best I could do was dig through SIEM firewall logs to find the IP address, but there wasn't even any specific details as far as if the traffic was blocked or not (it showed accepted). This leads into another issue where the Sonicwall's Syslog logging doesn't seem to include all of the Security Services events in a way that our SIEM can adequately parse the log data, even with custom parsing. The point is, all our Sonicwall's and their various security service components don't work well enough and I am really hoping to strike gold with Palo Alto (or someone else). Can someone speak to the quality of PAN to report on threats in real-time, with regards to things as simple as excessive port-scans and other intrusion attempts. I do understand that nodes on the WAN get scanned 24/7 which can result in endless alerts and things, but I would assume that there'd be some kind of visibility in the form of pop-ups and categorizations that can tell when/where/how frequently certain malicious activity is hitting our firewall. Additionally, I have been jumping into the PAN products and documentation and I see that the PA-3220 might be a good / similar unit to our current NSA 3600 and the various tools (like deep packet inspection) sound like they probably work a lot better than what I'm used to. The PA-420 or 220 looks like a decent replacement for the TZ500. Is there integrated Wi-Fi with PAN firewall units? Currently we use SonicPoint APs integrated with the firewalls, I'm hoping PAN has something similar. And input or insight will be greatly appreciated!",0,"

38,465574,Next-Generation Firewall Discussions,JPhilip,L1 Bithead,Intermittent random packet drops to/from NGFW,"What seems to be out of the blue, with no configuration changes on our firewall(s), we began experiencing random periods of ""network outages"" on our main data center firewall. The symptoms are as follows:Our pingdom test to our OWA website shows as down (i.e. the web page hosted behind the firewall cannot be reached from the internet)Users connected via GlobalProtect experience either horrible performance or outright disconnects.GP connected users running ping tests to internal resources show 10-60+% packet loss. (it varies widely)Users connected in the data center running ping tests to ISP gateway show similar packet loss patterns and experience horrible performance / no connection to the internet.This condition lasts 1-20+ minutes and is obviously causing major headaches.I've opened a TAC case, but as seems to be the case as of late, the wait times to talk to a human are long.We have an HA pair in an active/passive setup at the data center and I've failed over with no apparent change in this condition. I've also removed the in-line switch (that takes the one physical connection from our ISP and splits it to the HA pair) from the equation with no change in the condition.I can't MAKE it happen, but it has been happening regularly enough to be a real thorn in our side.I haven't seen anything in the system log that I recognize as being relevant to this behavior. I upgraded the pair to PAN-OS 10.0.8-h8 in the hopes I'd tripped an obscure bug and the update would fix it. Sadly it did not.If anyone as ideas, I am wide open to them.",0,"

41,461787,Next-Generation Firewall Discussions,JJoseph,L0 Member,Having issues with ipsectunnel after upgrading FWs(5260s) to 10.1.3,"Hello Palo Community! I have a a couple of ipsec tunnels connecting to a cloud vendor providing ERP services to our users. Since we upgraded our FWs to 10.1.3 a couple of weeks ago from 9.1.10, we are having issues with connection slowness, timeouts, ssh session termination, webpage not available etc where users aren't able to connect to any services on the other end. There is no issues with phase1 or 2 (gui status and sh vpn ike,ipsec, debug ike/ipsec commands etc ). This was confirmed by Palo(have a case open with them). When I look at the traffic log, the connections are ageing out, whenever I run the sh vpn flow name command when users can't connect, I see numbers increasing for encap packets and zero for decap. I have done packet captures, other commands (show counter global filter packet-filter yes delta yes) on the FW, sent to Palo and they say that they aren't seeing any packet loss from our side but aren't receiving response from the vendor side. I have to disable and enable the ipsec tunnel each time the connections drop(which is like almost every day) to bring back the connections for the users. It isn't happening at the same time every day either (which would have indicated some kind of processes running requiring heavy resource utilization or something like that causing this issue or coinciding with rekeying etc ). We compared the phase configs at both sides are they are setup with the same parameters. The other side is fortigate. There are no issues mentioned in the 10.1.3 release  incase this is a bug with this release, nothing mentioned in the 10.1.4 HF release as a fix either. I have a frustrated set of users and management asking me to solve this issue thinking it is a Palo issue(since this happened soon after the FWs were upgraded and it was working fine since the tunnel was created more than 6 months ago). I have 7 other ipsec tunnels without any issues at all working fine. Anyone else come across anything similar or or have any suggestions that I can try? Thanks!",0,"

42,415186,Next-Generation Firewall Discussions,vsys_remo,Cyber Elite,FlexVM Licensing with Software NGFW Credits,"Hi all,As you probably know, paloalto recently changed the licensing of VM firewalls. With greater flexibility (and higher licensing costs), there is now also the possibility to increase only the RAM for such a VM firewall which results in higher capacity for rules, zones, concurrent sessions. Some of the specs which change with a different memory profile are written here: https://docs.paloaltonetworks.com/vm-series/10-0/vm-series-deployment/license-the-vm-series-firewall... My question@ now are: are these the only specs that change with a different memory profile? What about concurrent dercypted sessions, virtual routers, ...? Does the vm refuse to boot if there is for example 20 GB of RAM attached or does the vm simply use the highes possible amount of RAM according to the memory profile?",1,"

46,409943,Next-Generation Firewall Discussions,Eric_Barger,L1 Bithead,Searching for missing logs in Next Gen Firewall monitor log.,"I am trying to firgure out two things.  background I have a Cisco ASA VPN concentrator that comes to my PA-5220 then goes to an application server.  I am having issues where i see logs in the ASA of traffic coming from the far end point of the tunnel on a constant basis, then going to the application server. I am not constantly seeing any logs in the Monitor. The application vendor acknowlegdes the traffic as well.  The logs I see is about 20 -30 minutes most of the time.  More interestingly is I have many customers coming in the ASA to the same Policy going to same application server on the same port. Those other IPs are showing constant logging.  Second issue is we see latency traffic between the two sides.. The application should have constant traffic every second or quicker.. What see is sometimes on a constant basis there is delays from 5 to 45 seconds.. again no logs in the PA First how can I check for the traffic in CLI ? In addition How Can I check to traffic to see if the PA is possibly causing the latency.?  thanks ",0,"
