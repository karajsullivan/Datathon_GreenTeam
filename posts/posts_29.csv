0,470717,Cortex XDR Discussions,ESJosephPrinz,L2 Linker,Join two data sets XQL,"Before I get into my failed script, please allow me to explain what Im attempting to do. We are looking for windows and Macintosh devices with cortex xdr agent NOT installed.  To do this we installed the cortex DHCP log collector. It is reporting its findings into asset manager.  The problem is that when an IP changes, the agent doesnt show this in the endpoint manager and as a result the cortex asset manager reports devices as without the agent when they actually do (cortex please fix this).  So we have hundreds of false positives. So, what we have to do is when DHCP logger reports a device with a new IP we have to look in endpoint manager for the name of the device. If we find it, the agent is installed, if we dont we need to audit the machine and install the agent if need be. Now, I could export both of these into a TSV, bring them into excel and do the work (and I have),.. however, we want this to be a report in the portal and we want to send alerts..   So, went into the xql query builder and tried a bunch of stuff..  Here is my lastest, which shows no errors in the edit box but the report finds nothing..  dataset = microsoft_dhcp_raw //| filter hostName != """"| alter hn1 = split(hostName ,""."") / dedup hostName//| dedup ipAddress //| union (dataset = endpoints)//| filter endpoint_name = hn1|join conflict_strategy = both type = inner (dataset = endpoints ) as EP EP.endpoint_name = hn1 | fields ipAddress,ip_address, hostName,hn1,endpoint_name When this didnt work, I figured it had something to do with my alter statement and used an IP which should surely have a match:dataset = microsoft_dhcp_raw //| filter hostName != """"| alter hn1 = split(hostName ,""."") |// dedup hostName| dedup ipAddress | union (dataset = endpoints)//| filter endpoint_name = hn1|join conflict_strategy = both type = inner (dataset = endpoints ) as EP EP.ip_address = ipAddress | fields ipAddress,ip_address, hostName,hn1,endpoint_name As you can see I played around with UNION as I have no idea what Im doing.  I left my commented out statements just to show what Ive played with.  Also, this would get me matches if it worked.. so how would I show no matches found for the join?Both show no errors in the editor but when I run it I just get: ERROR: FAILED TO RUN with no result. Im probably going about this all wrong, so any help would be appreciated. ",1,"

18,434071,Cortex XDR Discussions,BocoIP,L1 Bithead,Cortex XDR with Citrix App Layering and MCS,"We're in the process of installing a new setup with Citrix App Layering (Full User layers) and MCS. I've followed the suggestions here on non-persistent installation (VDI_ENABLED=1); even though our setup technically is sort of persistent (because of the Full User layers), it's still Golden Image-based and therefore needs to be VDI enabled. And this works fine as long as I'm editing the OS layer (which is the only supported layer, according to the same documentation), with Cortex XDR showing up in the dashboard as installation type VDI, with a golden image ID. But when I publish an image based on this layer, it is no longer a VDI type, but rather a Standard installation type, and the golden image ID is missing. While this technically works, and the endpoints get policy updates and show up in the dashboard ok, they're being duplicated at every boot, with the ""old"" instance remaining as Disconnected. So after for example five boots of a VM, I have one Connected and 4 Disconnected endpoints in dashboard. As far as I understand, this is exactly what the VDI_ENABLED=1 flag is supposed to remedy, but as it gets lost in the publication process, these are behaving like they're standard installations. My guess is that this is something that's set in the registry, which we (according to the support document) have added as an exception to Citrix App Layering:   I have tried looking around in those registry settings, but can't find what the VDI_ENABLED=1 part would be. So does anyone know what I need to include to get this working? Or is there something else I've missed or misunderstood? ",0,"

Support told us to wait for a specific content update to be released, which would (as had been appened) correct the problem.So, in a scenario like this: Agent profile grp_CriticalServers : cu delay: 3 days.Agent profile grp_Workstations: cu delay: none day 0: CU 500-00001 released, applied on grp_Workstations , grp_CriticalServers still on CU 500-00000day 1: CU 500-00001 works as expectedday 2: CU 500-00002 wreak havoc on grp_Workstations, grp_CriticalServer still on 500-0000day 3: CU 500-00003 and CU 500-00004 released , grp_Workstations now working normally. Question: at day 3, which content update will be served to the grp_CriticalServers? The last available 00004 ? 00001 and then after another 3 days, all the critical servers will be affected by the problematic CU 00002?In the first case, going straight to the last available come with some risks, the latter is not acceptable if there is no way to deprecate a CU. Or there is? The end goal is to use the vast majority of machines as canary for the critical servers. How did you manage a situation like that? Regards",0,"

My goal here is to prevent writing data to unapproved removeable media but allow reading. I created an device configuration extension profile with disk drives set as read only a few months ago a tested and it functioned as expected and blocked writes to my unapproved drive and allowed writes to my approved drive and still let me read data from it and it reported this all up to the console as "" device control violations"" which is good as we want our helpdesk to be able to do temporary override. Now fast forward to last week , i still had my profiles set up from when i tested this before and we want to start rolling this out. But now a pop up never happens when you try to write to the unapproved drive (still blocks it at least) and it does not report that up to the console (so wont be able to do temporary overrides). I opened a support case on this as i see in the agent logs errors when trying to display a pop up and errors with sending it to the console.....but support is coming back saying ""this is normal behavior"" and they will submit a feature request to get it to report up to the console.  So i guess i wanted to see if anyone else is having this issue, or how you go about locking down your removeable media. ",0,"

Our team tries not to make exceptions/whitelisting unless absolutely needed. Therefore, I believe teaching Cortex XDR correctly on what is safe and what is not is crucial.  For example when investigating successful logons from suspicious country (Low Sev Alert), if a user confirms that logon was done by them would this be closed as a 'True Positive' because XDR correctly detected alert or 'False Positive' because alert was safe.  Let me know your thoughts and/or how you would go about this. ",0,"

The others show a status of 'disconnected' or 'connection lost'. Is there a way to have the dashboard properly reflect the number of endpoints? According to https://docs.paloaltonetworks.com/cortex/cortex-xdr/cortex-xdr-prevent-admin/cortex-xdr-prevent-over...  "" In the case of non-persistent VDI, the Cortex XDR agent registers with Cortex XDR as soon as the user logs in to the endpoint.

220,345719,Cortex XDR Discussions,JimWaZ,L1 Bithead,Cortex XDR Exclusions vs Exceptions,"Hello all, Exclusions versus Exceptions, why is excluding an alert so much easier than creating an exception when it should be the opposite?  According to Palo Alto, ""If you do not want Cortex XDR to display alerts that match certain criteria, you can create an alert exclusion policy. After you create an exclusion policy, Cortex XDR hides any future alerts that match the criteria, and excludes the alerts from incidents and search query results."" In regards to alert exceptions, PA states ""In some cases, you may need to override the applied security policy to change whether Traps allows a process or file to run on an endpoint."" In practically all cases I am going to need to override the security policy that is blocking a homegrown PE that allows a department the ability to control their TV with their coffee cup. Do I want to just ignore (exclude) the action, and allow the Cortex agent to continue blocking the coffee cup from changing the channel? NO! The department is going to be irate with me because I can't even see the blocking action. Within Cortex XDR it is easy to create an exclusion, you can right-click, exclude, you're done.  For an exception, you need to pull your exception attributes from the alert, open the exception page, and input attributes where they are needed.  Why can't I right-click a hash, process, description, etc., and add as an exception?  Take it a step further, would you like to add this hash or whatever as a global exception or apply to a specific policy?  As a security analyst, I'm not going to suppress an alert but still allow it to continue blocking the file, process, etc.  I need to see all that is happening and suppressing an alert but allow the blocking action to happen is probably the last thing I'm going to do. This exclusion action can be buried deep in the Cortex realm of dark actions that never get used.",3,"

Is it univocally identified in the computer that is installed regardless of its name or IP address? If the computer with a complete image is replatformed, does it still count the old agent, which will no longer respond, in addition to the new one?

It is a resource for threat hunters to get additional information about incidents that they are already investigating.   Cortex XDR, in contrast, is designed to detect attacks—especially command and control, lateral movement, exfiltration, and compromised endpoints—by analyzing network activity. Cortex XDR also helps security analysts confirm threats with Pathfinder endpoint analysis.  Although both products help organizations investigate threats, they provide different types of data—threat intelligence information with AutoFocus versus network security alerts with Cortex XDR—and are designed for different stages in incident response processes.",8,"

416,409372,Cortex XDR Discussions,JEbrahimi,L0 Member,DTRH: Scripting Anything and Reaping Data,"  DTRH: Scripting Anything and Reaping Data OverviewCustomers are always asking for additional capabilities in the product and often times these feature request may come during a POC where having that capability can be the deciding factor in winning the deal. The feature request to delivered into the product can be a long cycle, often time you may be able to achieve the desired functionality through the scripting capabilities that exist today.In this DTRH, we are going to cover a real request from a customer in a POC and walk you through the basics of script creation and showing how we use the data from the script and make it usable in the Cortex Data Lake. Let’s start with the customer use case.  The customer already had some monitoring capabilities on the endpoint that would dump any PowerShell commands to a log file.  The wanted the capability to ingest the contents of that log file into the Cortex Data Lake with the additional goal of being able to search through the content via XQL.  Now if this were going to be a feature request it would most likely take considerable engineering effort to get it all done but let’s see how we can accomplish this in 25 lines of python code.  Creating the Script There are 2 main components for creating usable scripts in XDR.We will start taking a look at the script itself but there are some areas related to the UI that will dictate how we develop this script. Here is a look at the script in full:   First the entry point into function of script is set with ‘def run’, the entry point will be chosen and set when we add it to the UI.  Then you can have an arbitrary number of variables that are populated in the UI and passed to the script. In this case here we have 3: apiurl, apikey, path.   Now its best practice to have some error checking in your code, possibly checking the values of the variables and/or checking for possible exceptions in running. In this case, since we are dumping the contents of the file, one of the checks is to make sure the file exists and throw an error if it does not.   A script will then have a number of lines of code to complete the desired action(s) on the endpoint. For this script we are going to read in the contents of the file that we want to eventually insert into the Cortex Data Lake   For many scripts you may not need to even return any data back to the data lake so we could potentially return from the script at this point. In this case we are going to use another feature in the XDR console, the HTTP Event Collector, to pass data over that is stored in the data lake.  This is fairly straight forward but will require some additional setup in the UI to enable the collector and requires massaging the data that we are going to pass in as well. One of the main items to consider when using the HTTP Event Collector is that when we post data to it, every single newline is a break and will create separate events in the XQL. This could be the desired usage but in our case we are reading in an entire file that we would like to stay as a whole single event so we have to deal with these newlines. Here is the code for this:   What this does is replace every actual newline (\n) with the word ‘<newline>’. This will then basically turn the file into one long string with ‘<newline>’ as a separator. Not only does this create the separator and allow you to upload as a single event but through XQL you could potentially reverse the process in the UI and substitute ‘<newline>’ back to something else.The python requests library is a great addition to the language and allows for much easier web based transaction. The following code is something that would be valuable/reusable in other scripts that want to store data from the script into the data lake. Authorization is done through the API key which is created by the HTTP Collector and set through the UI. We will show both of these steps later but for now its just important to note that an API key (apikey) was created and it is passed in to the script. In addition, the URL for the API (apiurl) that we need to send the request to is handled the same way.   The body builds the actual content of data going into data lake as you can see in the post request which contains the API URL, the needed headers and the body. There is a check for a 200 response code from the server to validate the data was delivered without issue.  Refer to the Requests Python Library for more information but knowing these few lines of code can make any script push data into the Cortex Data Lake.   Connecting the Script To The UINow that we have the completed script, we will configure the UI to use it and fill in some of the pieces we discussed previously in more detail.  Let’s walk through this step by step.    Your script is now created and will show up in the script library with the information populated   Custom Collector for The Data LakeThis next step is around setting up the server to accept data from the script through a Custom Collector. It should be noted that for this script the goal was to get the data into the data lake. This step would not be needed if the data did not need to be ingested into the data lake.    ! It is important to note that the vendor and product name will be the name of dataset used by XQL. The overall dataset name will look like:<vendor>_<product>_raw  ! The API Token will pop up and must be copied. Once this window is closed there is no way to access this token anymore and if not saved a new collector would have to be created.        3. Once the collector is created there is a clickable link to copy the API URL that will be used to post the data to. Copy the link. Usage At this point everything has been setup and we can run the script. These steps will walk through a sample run. We have the API URL and API Key from the steps above, the two options that need to be added are what file we want to dump and on which endpoints should we dump this file from.        4. Click next and then you will be presented the endpoint you would like to run the script on. You can select any N number of endpoints you would like this to run on but remember that the file would need to exist on the selected systems.         5. Click  Run in the bottom right corned to execute the script on selected endpoints      6. In the Action Center click on All Actions to see the progress of the execution of the script. Once it has run on all endpoints you will see the Status if updated as completed.   ResultsNow that the script has run, the results will be stored in the Cortex Data Lake and we can query those results through XQL.! Remember the dataset name will follow the format <vendor>_<product>_raw. These values where set when we create the HTTP Collector     Tips/Tricks/HacksOne thing I learned in running this script over and over is that it is tedious to have to enter the API URL and API Key everytime when these values do not change. Really only the Path variable is something that you should have to populate each run. To achieve this result, you can hard code the APIKEY and APIURL into the script. This does put these credentials in the clear on the file system but they are only useful for being able to post to the HTTP Collector, but it is still something you should consider.By adding the apikey and apiurl here in the script, we also omit having those variables passed into the run function as seen below.   ConclusionIn only 25 lines of code, we were able to achieve new capabilities of the product and have the data stored in the Cortex Data Lake for searching. When a customer/prospect asks for something outside the current features it is worth looking at scripting to see if this can still be completed. ",8,"

Therefore the agent will never be able to connect to Cortex XDR, not even during/right after installation. While we could find a way to use the Content.zip which is available for download from the PA support portal alongside the installer itself, we are not sure about a way to export policies from Cortex XDR to feed them manually into the “offline” agent.We are also not sure about the license considerations, and the only piece of information I have found was informed that after 30 days when the endpoint has not communicated with Cortex Console we should see 'Connection Lost' notification.But I doubt it could actually be even something we will see in our scenario, as the agent will never communicate with the console.After some digging through the documentation we've come across information about the Cytool which might help to import/export the policies (for Windows and Linux machines).As I understand, in theory, I could import the policies from one agent and then export them to another one, is that correct?Unfortunately, I do not have any options to test it and I'm wondering if anyone had a chance to do it already, or maybe had some experience with a similar scenario and could share some thoughts? I will really appreciate some help on this one. Thank you in advance!",1,"

451,405048,Cortex XDR Discussions,YAlhazmi,L1 Bithead,Solution: How To View Cortex XDR Behavioral Threat Protection (BTP) Rules,"Hello everyone, We have, many times, received alerts with cryptic names like heuristic.agb.4477 or heuristic.b.346. Imho, creating a support case and waiting for a response is inefficient. Also, expecting us to blindly accept the support engineer response on whether that is a FP or not is not acceptable. Additionally, sometimes, we work with developers and our in-house applications get flagged. We can't advice developers on how to alter the behavior of their applications if we don't have enough information. Further, in our experience, support is not always as useful as expected. Sometimes the support engineer answer is more cryptic than the alert itself. Sometimes, explaining the issue takes too much back-and-forth discussions that take too much time and effort. Therefore, we digged a bit deeper into the logs and found out that we can read for ourselves what these cryptic names mean. To find out, download the alert data to your machine, then open the file Logs\trapsd.log. In that file, search for the cryptic alert name and you will be able to read the description of what it means. For example, one alert had the following descriptiona heuristic behavior that process created an exe file inside a system directory which isn't a subdir,copied itself,process relaunched itself,unsigned process was created,process launched external cmd. Another alert meant ""suspicious Powershell AMSI string"", and so on. We are considering making our own internal DB of these descriptions so investigators can immediately take action, instead of waiting for PAN support responses.  I am sharing this with the community because I saw multiple questions about this and most answers were a variation of ""talk to support"".",6,"

463,399033,Cortex XDR Discussions,JEbrahimi,L0 Member,DTRH: Finding New XQL Fields and Joining Data,"  DTRH: Finding New XQL Fields and Joining Data I was trying to look at some user login information through XQL and I started poking around the different fields that were being returned. I began one of the user login sample queries available in the query library and made a few small tweaks to de duplicate all the logins just so I could get a list of whatever account logged in that day.  The initial filter sets are event type and limits the results to a Windows event log ID 4624, which represents log ins. In the next line though you will notice that we extract a number of the field values from action_evtlog_message.The results returned looked like this:    I was curious what the numeric value Logon_Type meant and what was all contained in that field so I copied the entire value and took a look to see if I could determine this, In doing so I noticed that it was basically the entire event log as captured in the Windows event log.                    Sample Windows Event Log                                            XQL Field action_evtlog_message         This was interesting because it enlightened me to more of the fields that are probably available in the event log and other event logs that we capture.  Though even after going through all the data captured there still was no information to what the Logon_Type  actually represented. A little Google searching and I came to this Microsoft article which goes into detail around this event ID 4624:https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/security/threat-protection/auditing/event-4624 What I found in this article was the list of what the Logon types were and the description. This information was extremely valuable in understanding the various aspects that the logon could. For example was it a user physically at the system or over the network, was this a service account, were the credentials somehow passed in cleartext? I’m not sure why this information would not be in the log itself but as an analyst or someone investigating account activity it is extremely useful. This is actually a perfect use case for 2 XQL features, importing datasets and joining data! First, I need the logon information provided on the Microsoft website in a format that XDR uses for imported datasets which can be either json or comma separated values. CSV was the obvious choice so I made the text file and copied the fields over separated by commas. The first line of the file actually needs to be the field names and those will be searchable in XQL so I used LogonType, LogonTitle, and LogonDescription.  Each line contains the respective values for those 3 fields and here is the final result:   With this file completed I navigated back in the XDR console to ⚙️->Settings->Data Management and clicked +Lookup to import my newly created dataset.   Once the uploaded file is processed if becomes a new dataset usable within XQL. The name of the file becomes the name of the dataset and as previously mentioned the first line will define the field names. The file I used had a .txt extension and this also becomes part of the dataset name so to do this “cleaner” its probably best to leave off the file extension and just make sure the name of the file is something that would make sense when using. Now what I wanted to do was associate the information from the Microsoft website around what the logon types meant with the numeric value we displayed for LOGON_TYPE field in XQL.  To do this I used the XQL stage command ‘join’. The join command merges 2 datasets together based on a matching criterion that you define. In this case both the dataset we originally searched on had the field LOGON_TYPE and are created dataset had a matching LOGONTYPE field. In the query below you can see where I added the join to the original query , the joined dataset gets the name you specify it with using the AS function and then that name is the index used before the fields. In my case I called it LT  and I then need to match LT.LOGONTYPE with LOGON_TYPE:  This would be the field that we matched and would add the additional logon title and description to our results where the match occurred.  The joined created results that now provide much more context and information that we did not have prior to importing the new dataset. As you can see the result give you additional detail that would be very useful in an investigation     ",9,"

We have been looking into integrating several Cortex XDR instances into a single QRadar instance but have come across an issue where it does not seem to let us change the syslog identifier name on any of them. This leads to a problem distinguishing the different XDR tenants from each other as they are all showing up with cortexxdr as the identifier. All the XDR forwarding will be done over Syslog TLS.  Normally, when configuring syslog for other services we are able to change this, but that does not seem to be the case for XDR. But then again, we have not worked that much with XDR so hoping someone might have found a way of solving this.  Anyone had any luck implementing multiple XDR instances into their SIEM tool through syslog? Edit: Think we may have found a way of doing this, without involving a new server with rsyslog or similar. Will feedback if it works. ",0,"

We use split tunneling for the VPN, that means that only specified traffic goes through VPN tunnel to access internal resources and Active Directory services, the rest stays out of it. We also have different profiles for Internal and External network types, with a lot more restriction on the External. The issue is that due to most traffic being outside the tunnel, we want XDR Firewall to consider being an external network when connected to VPN. But the check that determines what type of network profile to apply does that with an LDAP connectivity test and a DNS resolve test for some internal domain. Both of these tests pass when connected to VPN. So far the only idea I have had is blocking LDAP connections in our office firewall when the traffic comes from VPN, but that seems like a bad solution. So maybe someone has experience with how to best solve this? If the DNS check would be rather ping, than resolve, then it would be an easy trick to just block pinging to that name for VPN subnet, but that is not the case.",0,"

Uploads that exceed the sample limit are queued for analysis after the limit resets. WildFire also limits sample sizes to 100MB. "" Based on the documentation WF should be able to deliver a verdict within 10-15 min after uploading the file (PE), which seems to be happening for most of the cases. Unfortunately but for some files, sent for Wildfire analysis after being Prevented (Blocked) on the XDR agent, the Cortex receives the verdict hours (sometimes days) later. The thing is, as per my understanding the wildfire should be able to take just seconds to run the analysis and to generate the report, but for any reason, the Cortex has received it only the next day.Also, I know that as for the Next-Generation Firewalls the signatures will be updated and shared within the next Content Updates, but it's not what I will expect for Cortex / Taps. *Am I missing something here, or it's something for the Palo Alto TAC to check? As additional info, I've noticed that the recent files impacted by this issue have been first prevented (blocked), and on the next day WildFire changed the verdict from ""Unknown"" to ""Benign"". Did anyone have similar issues in the past with WF?Could you please advise and point me in the correct documentation? I will appreciate your help to understand this issue.Thank you in advance and kind regards.",0,"
