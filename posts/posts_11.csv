The push operation reverts all existing configuration on the firewall and ensures that the firewall inherits only the settings defined in the template or template stack.If you push a configuration with Force Template Values ​​enabled, all overridden values ​​on the firewall are replaced with values ​​from the template. Before you use this option, check for overridden values ​​on the firewalls to ensure your commit does not result in any unexpected network outages or issues caused by replacing those overridden values.My important doubt since executing a bad action could apply changes that could affect the correct functioning of the Firewall, the doubt is with the ""Force Template Values"" option. **- This example option if I configure the DNS in Panorama to be able to override the LOCAL configuration of the firewall, which has other DNS and I want to configure both the DNS and the proxy from PANORAMA, with this option it would allow me to execute said change and override local settings ?**- In addition to this and the special care with this option is what happens in the example case if at the local level I have configurations of HA, of the IP of the MGT and at the Template/Template Stack level I do not have any configuration associated with these configurations, that is, configurations that are turned on that remain local, if I do not have any option in the template, no associated configuration and I only want to example adjust and replace the local configuration of the DNS, the Proxy and the NTP when using ""Force Template Values"" anyway, even if you don't have anything set in them, it will step on all the locales ? that is, I would leave them blank, thinking that I have nothing associated with HA, the MGT interface, when using ""Force Template Values"" in order to only step on and apply the DNS, proxy and NTP from the Panorama template, this option will not affect the local values ​​of HA and MGT ? I remain attentive, in advance thank you very much for the support and collaboration Best regards",0,"

The secondary Panorama ethernet1/1 interface will be disabled due to passive mode, and automatically enabled when the appliance becomes active mode (just like HA on firewalls)2. The secondary Panorama ethernet1/1 interface is enabled all the time regardless of active/passive mode (in this case we will use different eth1/1 IP on primary and secondary to prevent IP conflict)3.

I would like to 'copy' the certificate data (CA flag, private keys, etc) over to a new template within another Panorama instance.  I understand that I can export the cert + key, and import manually into the new template. This is part of a larger migration and I'd like to use the 'load config partial' command to copy the data over. I've already taken a configuration snapshot from my source panorama, and imported the configuration snapshot into my destination panorama.  This works fine if I wanted to grab the (source) PANORAMA certificates, but for some reason, I can't pull any cert data from the (source) template. When running the commands, I'm getting an error stating that the ""input file doesn't have anything at...""If I use the API browser, I can indeed see that there is no output on the screen, when I navigate to where the certs are located in my source template: devices/entry[@name='localhost.localdomain']/template/entry[@name='Global+Template']/config/shared/certificate I can drill into the template, but I don't see anything where I should see the certificates. If I look at the Panorama certificates, I do indeed see the certificates within the API browser? Does anybody know why this is happening? Any suggestions for a workaround?  For more context, I am essentially looking to 'copy' templates from a source panorama to a destination panorama. I've been using SET commands (get the SET commands from the source, and enter them into the destination), but manually copying the SET syntax for the cert is not working.  If there's a way to copy over the ENTIRE template via load config partial, then I'm all ears....

Device Group and Template Admins can only select the device groups, templates, or template stacks designated in their assigned access domain. Here my doubts about it related to this issue of restore / Load:Thinking about wanting to go back to do a rollback, after applying some configurations incorrectly, for example applying wrong configurations to Devices Groups, which should not be touched ( Example Changes in Device group 2,3 and 4 were correct OK, but by mistake, by not selecting and choosing, some changes were applied to Device Group-5, which had to be applied at another time and a push was sent without selecting or limiting the devices, but rather they were applied to all, and only had to be applied to the 2, 3.4 but not Device Group-5 ). In the previous case, what is the precise step for a proper and correct restore, it is enough to load the backup, the snapshot made prior to the changes, load it and then what happens with those boxes, those possible checkboxes to apply, the 3 indicated above (Load Shared Objects, Load Shared Policies, Select Device Groups & Templates), what would be the way to do it? If no checkbox is specified, everything is done, that is, it restores all Device Groups, Template/Template-stack and Panorama, performs a FULL restore of everything? Or, for example, you should select all the checkboxes and in the case of Device-Group and Template-stack choose all of them, thinking of a non-partial Full restore, or you should only omit the first checkboxes ( load shared objects and policies ) and choose Select Device Groups & Template and select all or part of it, as needed. I remain attentive, thank you very much, greetings and attentive to your comments.",0,"

59,486379,Panorama Discussions,nger,L1 Bithead,10.1 Panorama Registration Auth Key issues,"I am posting this question, and answer, for the benefit of the community. The Registration Auth Keys are a ONE TIME authorization key that allows a FW/WF/Logger device to talk to Panorama.  However, it appears that the order of configurations matters...and if the initial communication fails (for whatever reason) you must restart the pairing process again. Panorama and the Loggers were able to PING one another and SSH between the two was working. 1.  We created the Registration Auth Key on Pano - only defining the ""key type"" Logger, we did not fill in any serial numbers.2.  We then converted 4 pano boxes into dedicated loggers3.  We added the Registration Auth Key to each of the loggers4  Then in Pano, we created 4 ""Collector"" profiles - filling in ONLY the serial number of each collector ....but none of the loggers would pair with Panorama. Turns out the client had some firewall policies in place that was preventing the initial handshake.  The policies were allowing PING but the Logger IPs had not been added to the policy that permitted Panorama port 3978.  After discovering and correcting those policies the loggers still wouldn't pair with Panorama.  In addtion, after fixing those policies those same FWs were now seeing small bit traffic from the Logger to the Panorama on port 3978.  So it looked like communication was happening but Pano still wasn't registering the devices. 5.  We then removed the Auth keys from the loggers and then re-added the SAME key on all the loggers6.  After that, all 4 loggers were than able to pair with the Panorama. Thus the take away is that after the logger tries to send the Registration Auth key it does not attempt again. The FW policy blocked that singular attempt, thus Panorama was never receiving that initial Auth key for the first time pairing.  This implies that, literally, the one time key is used only once - if communication is not established, it doesn't try again until the key is removed and added again.Maybe others can chime in on this to confirm the above observed theory.  ",0,"

What is the operation that occurs in this case, the template and the injected configuration overlaps the local configurations and overwrites them and always defines them as from the template, or will I get some kind of error when doing the push from Panorama and which are partly the same settings and parameters? 2.- It is only enough to move the firewalls from one Tempalte Stack to another so that Panorama injects the configurations ? or in this matter of the template/template sktack there are other details and considerations? It is enough to move the Firewalls, from a template stack and the configurations injected by the old template stack, they will disappear and only the Network and Device configurations will be present, from the new Template Stack, that is, they will receive the configurations only from where they were moved and added, of the temple of destiny?

66,481211,Panorama Discussions,benlewis,L2 Linker,Failed migration to Panorama 10.1.3,I had an issue recently when attempting to migrate a 3250 HA pair (10.0.8-h4) to Panorama 10.1.3.  I was able to complete the push and commit however anything that uses a password or secret such as a IKE Gateway pre-shared key didn't work.  The resultant outage was significant with over 100 IPSec VPN's configured so I quickly reverted the 3250's to their original device state.  I suspected someone had set a new Master Key however that wasn't the case.  I then compared the encrypted values for passwords and pre-shared keys between firewalls and Panorama and they were indeed different.  I know Panorama 10.1.3 doesn't support firewalls running 10.1.0 - 10.1.2 (Panorama Admin Guide) however I can't find official word that 10.0.X isn't supported either.Downgrading isn't really an option as 10.0 becomes end of life in July this year so next step is trying the process again with an eval VM running 10.0.8-h4 loaded with very similar config to the 3250's and see if the same result occurs.  Following on from that I will upgrade Panorama and the VM to 10.1.5-h1 to see if the issue is resolved.  I have another 15 x 440's on Satellite links to migrate so need to make sure the process is error free.,0,"

It is the log collector for all our firewalls.We just procured a second Panorama VM for HA etc. Naturally, this will also be in Panorama mode and act as a log collector (I've yet to put it in HA as I am trying to see if I change the logging to the eth interface). I no longer wish to have logging traffic go to the MGMT interfaces of both Panoramas. I have configured eth1/1, and all are working at layer 3. For device management services I've set ""device management and log collection"" and ""Collector Group Communication"" for the same interface. All settings are committed to the log collector. When I got to managed collectors, I only see the Panorama the MGMT's IP address. I would have expected to see the new IP for eth1/1.How does one ensure logging traffic flows to Panorama using only the eth interface and no longer its mgmt interface? As briefly mentioned, I've only tried this with the new Panorama VM instance.

96,463079,Panorama Discussions,S_Hiebert,L1 Bithead,clean up unused objects within Panorama using expedition?,"hello all,PA newb here. I recently transitioned to a firewall admin job and am learning my way around Palo Alto for the first time. one issue I've been tasked with exploring is an issue where one of our firewalls has fallen out of sync because it is a VM and has limited object storage capabilities. it is the only VM in our production network. We've explored the idea of just unchecking the ""share unused objects"" box in panorama, but apparently some of my predecessors weren't so careful when crafting new local rules on other firewalls throughout our AS and referenced panorama pushed objects in their local rules. needless to say this going to be a quagmire of a project to clean up the firewalls, and after that's done, I'm sure there will be a lot of unused objects leftover in panorama after the cleanup is finished.while doing some digging I discovered PA has a tool called Expedition which can supposedly identify and remove unused objects in PA firewalls. can expedition be used with panorama in this same capacity? that would make my life a million times easier because otherwise I see no way to identify whether or not an object or applicable object group is used.  any insights would be much appreciated. ",0,"

I noticed it especially on a customer with around 50 ipsec tunnels, where after the migration the log was full with authentication failures. So after reentering all preshared keys in the panorama templates for all of the ipsec tunnels, they all came up.I also noticed it with the ldap configuration. Right after the migration I was not able to login to the firewall with an LDAP user and we saw in the logs of the LDAP server, that there was a wrong password for the configured palo alto LDAP service user. Again, after reentering the password of the LDAP service user on the panorama template, I was able to login again with LDAP. I have seen this behavior on multiple customers now, with different firewalls (440, 5220, vm-series). They all had in common that they were running a Panorama version 10.0.8+ or 10.1.2+ with firewalls running 10.0.8+ (5220, vm-series) or 10.1.2+ (440). Has anyone else seen this behavior? Am I missing something in the steps for Panorama migration?I learned now, that when I have to migrate to panorama, that I change all passwords before I push the config back to the devices. Thank you all,Martin",0,"

And will the import include both panorama objects and localized policies? If the import is possible, the intent would be to move the 5060s back to their original device group and templates for production support. And then place the 5450s under the new imported 5060 group which would include both objects and policies to push to them for customization as needed in preparation for production replacement The questions at hand: Can this be done?If so, how best to accomplish each step?If not possible with about approach, then how to accomplish? Looking for assistance here.

It shows up here and we are ready to push configs.Said firewall have a template stack associated, and it's placed in a device group to receive a base set of policies. Now the template-stack contains all network definitions, like for instance interface names and zones. Part of the zone configuration we have configured a zone logging profile that sends Zone logs to panorama.  We did this since we saw for instance scan sweep warnings in the firewall logs, but not in Panorama logs (forwarded) and figured out this was part of the zone logging, but not rule or threat logs. Funny thing though is that Log forwarding settings is configured under objects in the device groups section, while it's then possible to use it in a template, like I have done as a log forwarding profile on a security zone. Now trying to perform a push to the new firewall, it ends up being 2 different commits on the firewall. One commit for all the device group config (policies and objects), and one commit for the template configurations. So the Policy push (commit) fails since the security zones are not present. A second push attempt would have fixed this if the template commit had been successful, but this fails also since the log forwarding profile used on the security zone isn't in place due to the policy commit failing, and behold we have a dependency loop. There are workaround to this of course, but I find that a bit tedious, and I was a bit caught out by this dependency loop between template and objects in device groups. Any tips or tricks to be shared about this conundrum ?I would really like to be able to just assign a firewall to the device group and template it should belong to right from the start, instead of applying a 2 step procedure with an in between template or device group.",0,"

Also this entire thing is managed via Panorama so don't need ""do local FW overrides of templates"".  Also virtual systems not an option in many cases as the majority are low end small site models (i.e. 800's and down) hence don't need to get into ""spin up a virtual system and control it that way"" discussions. Anyways anybody have a config snippet they want to share for setting up the following two custom admin roles? 1) GP Admin - Needs access to the FW running GP (not all of them, just one), the ability to configure it all, maintain it, etc (via Panorama templates) but NOT anything else in Panorama or the FW. 2) Ditto but Network Engineer - I.e. needs access to the virtual routers, L2/L3 configs, interface configs, routing tables, etc but not stuff like admin database, authentication setup, security policy or objects, etc. The built-in rolls are ill equipped for this and I know how do do via effective superuser via Device Templates/Admin a per FW / virtual system level but I'm looking for more fine tuned than that i.e. ""Just every function GP needs and nothing more"" or ""Every function a network engineer would need to treat the PA like a L3 device but nothing more""",0,"

What is unusual about this is the amount of data that is either being sent or received as part of this ping. See image for our Solarwinds below. In one instance 300+MB was transferred. The data transfer during each session is not equal. In the first entry the sending device only transfers 60Bytes and receives over 300MB. Sometimes it is the other way around.  I have ruled out extended pings (ping -t). The firewall shows these as a series of pings not a single event.

Can we export the config snapshot -> import on the new VM -> and then convert to legacy mode? If this is possible will this lose our log settings in Panorama? How do we handle this from the licensing perspective? Once we are on the new VM and have transferred the license, can we still view historical logs as needed on the old Panorama VM? I have a ticket open with support for guidance as well, but was looking to see what the communities thoughts were. ",0,"

As we have enabled log forwarding to panorama/logging service for all log types , all logs forwarding to panorama. What about cortex data lake ?. Firewall forwarding only url logs or all logs to cortex data lake ? If all logs forwarding to cortex data lake and we are storing only url logs then it will be unnecessary utilization of our internet bandwidth. Q2. Can we forward only url filtering logs only to cortex data lake , same logs should not be forwarded to panorama. Q3 . As we have enabled duplicate logging , additional cortex data lake instance is not helping us to improve log retention as its storing the same logs which on-premise panorama is storing. We need some alternative so that logs will be forwarded either to panorama or cortex data lake to manage logging disk. Q4. in addition to my second query (Q3) , currently all four locations firewall is managed via panorama. out of this if we forward two firewall logs only to cortex data lake then we can achieve our requirement , want to know configurational changes and challenges.I have reviewed cortex data lake admin guide , found below consideration :- if we disabled duplicate logging option in firewall (device >setup > mgmt >cortex data lake) , any chance of loss of logs of old logs stored in panorama.- can we onboard panorama managed firewall ? here log will forward to cortex data lake but firewall will be managed by panorama.Because currently cortex data lake is bind with panorama and through panorama all firewalls were connected to cortex data lake.  ",0,"

Since we replacing existing M-200 devices, the HA settings are migrated from working M-100 pair. The HA connectivity seems to be fine since I both Panorama can see each others status and shows state in the dashboard. The problem is that one of the Panorama showing App Version and Antivirus Version as ""Unknown"". The App and AV version are same on both Panorama. The same Panorama is however able to detect Panorama Version, HA1 status and Peer status fine. When I run ""Sync to peer"" I get ""Could not push HA Configuration to peer. Failed to synchronize running configuration with HA peer"" message immediately. Can someone point to possible causes? I have already rebuilt the HA as well as restarted both Panorama devices with no luck. Other Panorama: ",0,"

317,404493,Panorama Discussions,Deepak_K,L3 Networker,Panorama HA upgrade to 10.0,"We have query regarding log collector group  while upgrading Panorama M200 Ha pair from PANOS 9.1.6 to PANOS 10.0.5.Is there any issue in log collector status or log forwarding to collector group ?We have  log collector group( with enable log redundancy) and  local log collector of both panorama are added into same LC group in our production setup. HA and log collection config using management interface on both panorama. We have tested Panorama HA upgrade from PANOS 9.1.6 to PANOS 10.0.5 on testing setup.(We couldn't configured LC in testing setup)First we have upgraded Primary Panorama to Panos 10.0.5 , when it came up it went to non-functional state due to panos version mismatch. HA1 was up and secondary panorama became active. To make the upgraded Primary panorama device functional had to suspend Secondary panorama. HA1 was up even after suspending Secondary panorama. Is there any issue in log collection or LC status if we suspend secondary panorama If yes, then logs should redistribute from LC1 (pri panorama ) to LC2 ( Sec panorama ) after making secondary panorama functional. We want to keep production Sec Panorama in suspend state and want to monitor upgraded pri panorama for 7 days.So after upgrading panorama after 7 days , LC2 of sec panorama should have some logs stored in its logging disks.   ",0,"

319,320409,Panorama Discussions,JoshuaBolin,L1 Bithead,Panorama GUI Slowness and refreshes after upgrade to PAN-OS 9 on M-600,"I have two separate large customers who are both experiencing the same issue.  They both have M-600 Panorama appliances in dedicated management mode with HA peers and dedicated log collectors.   After upgrading to PAN-OS 9.0.x (currently on 9.0.4) - the GUI is slow and refreshes after each change.  For example, if you add a TAG to a rule, the section will refresh before you can click on another.  If you drag and drop a tag between rules, the maximum you are going to get is two before it refreshes.  If I'm performing multiple changes to a policy, after a few rules in it will start jumping back to the top of the policy after every refresh.  It's very annoying and leaving a bad impression of the GUI with the customers.   Is this a known issue?  Is there a fix to this issue?  I'm struggling to find any answers through searching Live and other tech blogs.",0,"
