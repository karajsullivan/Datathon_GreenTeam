15,411800,mivaldi,"Full FQDN blocking on SSL encrypted websites is only possible if the Web Browser being used declares it in the Server Name Indication (SNI) extension which is optional, or if it matches literally with the CN presented in the Server's Certificate. Besides the Web Browser choosing not to expose the FQDN in the SNI, there are two other situations that can prevent URL Filtering matching:1. The browser in use is Google Chrome, and the connection is established using the QUIC protocol instead of using HTTP(S). The solution is to create a Security Policy at the top of your security policy set blocking application 'quic'.2. The browser in use is encrypting the Client Hello (ECH) or encrypting the SNI (also known as ESNI), which are options in TLSv1.3. In that case you will not be able to read the SNI and you may need to resort into taking a decision based on the validity of the Root CA signer. You can set a decryption profile without rolling out SSL Decryption, and check with a no-decrypt Decryption Policy to see if the root CA is trusted, and if not, block the connection.The best way to determine what situation you're encountering is to run a packet capture of one of your user's traffic being allowed.",2,06-08-2021,04:41 PM

30,503092,vekPAN,"Hi @VivekPAN ,Do you have other L7 rules that might allow tcp/27017 before the application is identified? When you telnet to a port, you execute the TCP 3-way handshake. This traffic may be allowed until the NGFW sees enough packets to identify the application. Once the NGFW has determined the application, it can allow or deny the traffic based upon the L7 rules. The best practice to avoid allowing these initial packets is to ensure that you set application-default as the service for your L7 rules. Then only the default ports are initially allowed. Verify you do not have an L7 rules with a service of any. For apps with non-standard ports, use a custom service.Thanks,Tom",0,06-17-2022,10:01 PM

For example, I have the below policy in place in my FW. The actual SSL application works fine from the source to the destination. But if I do a ""telnet172.1.1.2 443"" from source -10.1.1.1, the connection gets ""TCP timeout"" as a result. Do I need to allow ""Telnet"" application also in the same policy to make this work? And which means telnet'ing the destination with TCP port does not help to verify the 3-way handshake unless we don't have ""telnet"" app is allowed between them?source - 10.1.1.1destination - 172.1.1.2destination port - 443application - sslservice - application-defaultaction - allow",0,06-19-2022,03:50 PM
32,503092,vekPAN,"Hi @VivekPAN ,That's very interesting. Do you have any rules with a service of ""any""? That may allow the TCP 3-way handshake on port 27017. Or maybe application-default for one of your applications may include port 27017.Query #2 is actually very related to query #1. I would think the Telnet would initially succeed. Maybe it does more than the 3-way handshake.Thanks,Tom",1,06-29-2022,01:12 AM
33,503092,TomYoung,"Regarding Query #1, I would suggest to replicate it again and check the Session Browser (Monitor > Session Browser) to see which security rule the traffic is hitting. Then, it will be much clearer what's happening.Regarding Query #2, since you said, ""the actual SSL application works fine"" and the service port is 443, I understand that an https server is running on port 443. If you run ""telnet 172.1.1.2 443"", the application won't be identified as ssl simply because it's not ssl thus the traffic won't hit the security policy that you mentioned. It won't be identified as telnet either because telnet server isn't running on that port (443). The firewall will not identify the application based on the port number, so the TCP 3way-handshake isn't enough to identify the application.What do you want to achieve or what do you expect by running ""telnet 172.1.1.2 443"" against an https server?

This may be an actual threat, or it may be a false alert, you need to look deeper at the logging to determine what exactly it is alerting on and whether it was blocked/connection reset or was just an alert (depending on the type and severity of the alert, different actions can occur). Since you say this is from an internal IP to an external IP, this could be malware calling home, ""bad"" or suspect DNS requests, attempts to compromise external addresses, or something that was just misidentified as such.Start by going to the logs at Monitor -> Threat and look at the details of the individual threat detections. It may indicate a particular malware/virus/etc. with links to a ThreatID number with more information. Or it may be something benign that is just being alerted to. For example: A alert log that a workstation is doing DNS lookups of a domain associated with malware. Or one we frequently get, ""HTTP Unauthorized Brute Force Attack"" logs where in the morning a client window has been left open to a website and the user auth has expired, the user attempts to refresh the page which results in a string of 401 Unauthorized server responses which the PaloAlto misidentifies as an attempt to brute force user login.",1,03-10-2022,01:11 AM

160,450089,avelK,"Hi@PavelK.Thanks for your inputs.I am going through the documentations and my understanding from those documentations is that the firewall handles HTTP and HTTPS traffic differently.For HTTP traffic the firewall allow till the GET packet to identify the HTTP website the user is trying to access and blocks the HTTP site. So the initial packets will be allowed.Same for HTTPS site the firewall will allow the traffic of TCP handshake , SSL/TLS handshake and then once the firewall get the Certificate it will look into the CN name of the certificate and will block that session. So we will see few packets going out to the websites when we filter on traffic log using the website IP address.This is my understanding",1,11-29-2021,03:37 PM

221,306949,prashant.sharma,"You can mitigate this vulnerability by having traffic that routes to the management interface be scanned by a Vulnerability Protection profile which should be set to reset-both on High severity vulnerabilities. Since the firewall does not run IPS on the traffic destined to the management *port*, the recommendation implies that you would either force management traffic through the firewall, or migrate the WebUI management of the device to a data port for in-band management (where the Vulnerability Protection profile can scan the traffic) using an interface management profile, and/or, mitigate risk by restricting access to the management port. This is covered in our documentation at https://docs.paloaltonetworks.com/pan-os/10-1/pan-os-admin/getting-started/best-practices-for-securi...Other than the in-band solution, a few ways to force traffic through the firewall for out of band management are to:1) Create a Layer 3 interface in a spare data port on a separate Management Zone, associate a management interface profile to it, and define all service routes to source from this interface. Define an intrazone security policy for the Management Zone with an associated Vulnerability Protection profile to have the traffic scanned. This solution requires a single spare data port.or,2)Create a vWire on two data ports, connect one port of the vWire to the management port and another to your management network switch. Define a security policy for the vWire with an associated Vulnerability Protection profile to have the traffic scanned. This solution requires two spare data ports. The advantage in this scenario is that it provides true management isolation and that for any required services that do not honor Service Routes, traffic will continue to source from the Management port.By the way, 10.1.2 and 9.1.11 have already released.",0,09-09-2020,01:28 PM

271,422849,JasonPeterson,"Alerts triggered by DNS security are part of the actions defined in your anti-spyware profile, hence following a logic that those are typically triggered by traffic coming from the intrazone (trust) to Untrust. I'd recommend investigating those alerts with TAC (open a case) before adding an exception. That could be the case of a False Positive in which case the signature triggered is modified or removed and you don't need to do anything in XDR; or could be the case of a true detection in which case the system is protecting you by blocking the access to a potentially malicious domain.

If the firewall cannot find it, it will instead use the certificate marked as Forward Untrust Certificate.By the way, it is a BAD IDEA to mark both Forward Trust and Forward Untrust in the same certificate, because you will push this certificate to workstations as a certificate that your devices should trust. That means that if the firewall finds a server certificate that is not trusted, it will present the device with a certificate it trusts, and therefore make it seem to the end user that anything out in the internet is trusted, even when they browse to websites or use applications that present with invalid SSL certificates.",0,07-23-2021,10:12 PM

395,382251,OtakarKlier,"When we produce signatures in a rush because the general public really needs a protection, we don't have the luxury of time to FP soak our signatures, so we release default actions that by default are not set to block, so that mission-critical environments can at the very least set their actions to 'default' without risking service downtime due to an unexpected false positive detection. For non mission critical environments we recommend as a best practice to reset-both on Critical, High and Medium severity threats, and to set action default on Low and Informational severity threats.In this case, the reset-both action for Medium severity threats would override the default alert action that shipped in the signature metadata.The best-best practice that comes to mind in general for any types of threats is to block by Regions. You can block countries that pose a high risk from initiating traffic to your organization. There has to be of course, a business decision taken before you can block a whole country from being able to reach your organization. As a second rule you can also look into blocking countries that your devices should not reach-out to.In the case of the actions, -Drop, Block IP (client or server?), or Reset [client|server|both]? - It really depends on what you want to achieve.In the case of a Drop, the client initiating the traffic will have no feedback as to what happened, so if there is an application that does not function due to a firewall protection, there will not be any type of packet that can be traced for troubleshooting. The added benefit is that because there is no response, threat actors will also not know if there is a device there or not. In the case of a RST they can deduce that you have a firewall blocking the request, which can be considered by some as reconnaissance.A problem with Drops is that the client and server will also not have any clue as to what went wrong, so they may continue trying to communicate with TCP retransmissions for example. The user experience may be that the application has 'hanged' or that a download 'stalled' but there is no clear-cut immediate closure of the connection. Injecting a RST to the client helps the user see that the connection was refused, and there is more immediate feedback about the situation. In the case of a RST to the server, the server will free-up that TCP resource faster, so sending a reset to a server will increase its availability of resources.A block-IP is a hardware accelerated discard. It sends the source IP to a blacklist for a set period of time. The difference is that it won't only block a given session, but it blocks any connections sourced from that IP for the set time lapse. This is better used for sources that are attempting volumetric type attacks such as brute force of network floods, where the rapid succession of packets can begin to exhaust the firewall or server resources.",1,01-28-2021,12:53 PM

This new file type enables visibility for files that are binary encoded and not identified as any other supported file type. For customers who want visibility into transfers of ""unknown-binary"" files in their networks, we recommend that you set this file type to ""alert"" so that you can observe where these files appear in your network traffic. We also recommend that you monitor your Data Filtering logs for ""Unknown Binary File"" for several weeks before you consider updating to a more severe action (""block"" or ""continue""). If you are running a PAN-OS 9.0 release with an ""alert all"" rule in your file-blocking profiles (which includes the predefined ""basic file blocking"" and ""strict file blocking"" profiles), expect to see logs for ""Unknown Binary File"" after you install this content update; additionally, you can configure the ""unknown-binary"" file type in File Blocking profiles.

527,254372,hearak.Sem,"FP means False Positive.A False Positive happens when a signature triggers for benign traffic.For Palo Alto Networks firewalls there are three common types of False Positives.1) WildFire False Positive: WildFire arrives at an incorrect verdict, assigning a malicious verdict to a benign file. The general resolution is to identify what caused the incorrect verdict, then flip it to Benign.2) Antivirus Collision with False Positive: This happens when a Benign file triggers a signature that was created for a file that WildFire assigned an incorrect malicious verdict (as described in #1). The reason for this is that the digital patterns that the Palo Alto Networks parses to identify a Malicious sample coincide in those found in the Benign sample. The general resolution is to identify what is the original sample that created the signature and identify what caused the incorrect verdict, then flip it to Benign.3) Antivirus Collision with True Positive: This happens when a Benign file triggers a signature that was created for a file that WildFire correctly identified as malicious.The reason for this is that the digital patterns that the Palo Alto Networks parses to identify a Malicious sample coincide in those found in the Benign sample.

637,281518,Mark_Baik,"I know this thread is couple months old but I'll post a response anyway.There are 6 critical vulnerabilities from the Urgent/11 family.CVE-2019-12256A specially crafted IP packet sent to the target can cause a stack overflow in the handling of IP options in the header to possibly cause remote code execution. If you have a device (like our NGFW) that can clear IP options from the IPv4 header for ingress traffic, you can neutralize this exploit. Palo Alto Networks NGFW does not clear IP options by default so you can create a specific zone protection profile that drops relevant IP options and apply to the segment where your vulnerable VxWorks device is connected. ""Network tab - Zone Protection Profile - add - Packet based attack protection tab""CVE-2019-12255, CVE-2019-12260, CVE-2019-12261, CVE-2019-12263These 4 vulnerabilities all leverage manipulating TCP URG flag/pointer. Palo Alto Networks NGFW clears URG field as the default, out of the box configuration, neutralizing these attacks. This is a global setting however and cannot be applied only to a specific zone. You can run the following command to check your NGFW's current setting: ""show running tcp state""From the web GUI, under the Device tab - TCP Settings.CVE-2019-12257Exploiting this vulnerability requires the attacker to send a crafted DHCP server response before the actual DHCP server response gets to the victim host. Configuring security rule from your NGFW to only allow DHCP traffic from your authorized DHCP server can thwart such attacks. This wouldn't obviously work if the attacker was on the same network as the victim host. If such implementation is not feasible due to other devices in the network, consider isolating vulnerable devices to their own network segment/zone(s) to be able to apply the desired FW security rule.@jesseholland@Eusono@tmcneil@matthewroberson@KevinMedeiros",0,10-23-2019,09:31 AM

It looks like the default protection built-in to traps unfortunately doesn't seem to catch this. I'm still trying to determine if there is a configuration change (focusing on the Exploit Profiles) that will protect the process that is exploited as part of this CVE (CVE-2019-0708).The testing methodology that I have used is as follows:1. Spun up a Windows 7 VM, and fired a PoC Crash exploit at the unpatched system. This resulted in a Blue Screen and the machine cratched. Presumably if someone modifies this Blue Screen PoC code to get their own RCE (Remote Code Execution), then they could get their code executing on a system without a Blue Screen.2. Next, I installed the latest Traps Agent on the Windows 7 VM, and rebooted. After the reboot, I fired the PoC crash exploit at the unpatched system yet again, and acheived the same result, with nothing being reported in the Traps Management Service.I plan on opening another support ticket to inquire now that there is PoC code available. I'll post the results of that here later.Thanks",1,06-10-2019,06:26 PM

As these triggering based on amount of traffic based on protocol. For zone protection, this would be for the ingress zone and for DoS protection it would apply to whatever matches your DoS policy.Generally I like to set a relatively low alert and a relatively high activate/maximum thresholds, and then scale up the alert until your normal network traffic is no longer triggering an alert.Keep in mind that whether you're using RED (random early drop) or SYN cookies, the percentage of traffic that is ""actioned"" scales linearly between activate and maximum. So if my activate is 10,000 and my maximum is 20,000, each increase in 100 connections per second (1% of the difference between 20,000 and 10,000) is going to cause the firewall to action 1% more traffic.The document below is a personal favorite and goes pretty far into depth on our coverage as a whole.

789,232061,mivaldi,"You are referring to the options that pop up when you click on select Vulnerability signatures that do have a 'Pencil and Paper' icon at the left of the Threat Name entry.These are special 'Combination' signatures, the way they work is you have a parent and a child signature. Some people refer to them as a witness (for the parent) and event (for the child) signatures.The idea is that the event(child) based signature is tracking events that by themselves(as isolated events), are not malicious in nature - i.e., login attempts to an SSH server,however, if you see a big numberof these events in a very short time, it can be an indication of a brute force attempt.The key concept is the time component. The witness(parent) signature is tracking the n-ocurrences of the event(child) in a specified time window.Event(Child) signatures do not need to write entries to the Threat logs to be counted by Witness(Parent) signatures. This means that the Parent signature will count ocurrences of the Child signature, even if it is not logging to the Threat Logs (action allow).The source or source-and-destination aggregation criteria refers to definition of what the witness is counting as events in a given time-window. Going back to our example, if the same source is attempting to log-in using SSH to multiple different destination IP's within the specified time window, and your aggregation criteria is only source, then these eventswill all count toward the trigger condition of the witness signature, however, if you define it as source-and-destination, you define additional granularity and you'd be instantiating multiple time-windows where the trigger condition that is counted is the n-number of instances where a single source goes to a *specific* destination.You can read additional details in our ""Creatingcustom applicationand threat signatures""document available athttps://knowledgebase.paloaltonetworks.com/KCSArticleDetail?id=kA10g000000ClOFCA0 (See Combination Signatures in Page 65).There is also additional information on Brute Force signatures available athttps://knowledgebase.paloaltonetworks.com/KCSArticleDetail?id=kA10g000000ClmpCAC",0,10-03-2018,04:17 PM

821,209766,aayoung,"So, first of all, I may not be understanding exactly what you're saying is going on, but basically, it sounds like you're getting an error when attempting to access content from https/SSL sites. If that is what is occurring, the cause is because that once you enable decryption, your end devices first attempt to set up an SSL connection with your PA, then your PA sets up an SSL connection with the intended server, or true destination on the internet, allowing for full visibility of the traffic in the path or stream of data. However if your end devices don't have the certificate (verifies the owner of thepublic key, is who they say they are) created on your firewall, they will not be able to set up the desired SSL connection, and will label any connection as ""untrusted"" and may even cause sites to be un-reachable altogether. My first question would be, have you used some type of AD push or manual method (depending on the size of your environment) to install your PA SSL Certificate into the trusted certificate stores on your end devices. Also, let me add that for any idevices (iphone, Ipad etc.....) you'll have to create an exception manually, because of the way they've set up their Trusted Certificate Store.",0,08-25-2018,04:31 AM

880,203905,mivaldi,"There are acouple things that are incorrect.The first thing is,you are assuming that a Malicious verdict from WildFire on a file, means instantaneous Antivirus coverage. Once WildFire determines a sample is malicious, it sends it to PAN-AV, which generates a signature for the sample. This signature is then stacked, and is released every 5 minutes. You have to actually fetch the WildFire-Virus database to the firewall through Dynamic Updates for it to have the signature to detect files matching its pattern.The second thing, is you are assuming WildFire would create an AV signature for the WildFire PE file, and that's not true. The WildFire PE file is only meant to test the WildFire forwarding (uploading sample to WildFire) and receiving back a report from WildFire, but it does not send the WildFire PE file to PAN-AV, so a signature is never generated for it.",3,03-06-2018,09:41 AM

I have a VWire that is protecting another device and I do have threat protection on it. This way the PAN can block/stop the traffic so the vwire device doesnt get hit with it. For me everything inbound gets this treatment, i.e. the border. Outbound traffic is a different story, some I do and some I dont. It protects not only me if a host is potentially compromised but also others so my potentially compromised host doesnt attack someone else.I hope that makes sense.Regards,",0,12-18-2017,03:56 PM

Remeber that you can be selective, and apply other profiles if you need too.Since it is an internal application, and you seem to trust it, if performance is an issue, I would create this security policy with the DSRI feature in disabled state.A session on the firewall comprises two flows, client to server and server to client.

1002,150920,Willian,"@arnold.dsilvaJust wanted to highlight a couple of new useful IPS signatures and a new File Type that was released last year to help customers with files that are used for malware/ransomware. Some of these are potentially malicious payloads as well.1) Detection of .js files sent over email. Malware and Ransomware is often sent by these methods. Both of these are set to informational, so the customer should look at selectively enabling/blocking. 39002 looks for a plain .js file sent over email. 39003 looks for a .js inside of a .zip. This is currently PAN-OS 7.0 min version due to decoder changes only available in 7.0+ but we will look at bringing that to more PAN-OS versions. We are looking at .wsf files next.2) There is also another signature, ""HTML MIME Entities Masquerading As Word Documents” that is also good at detecting malware/ransomware campaigns that include MS Office documents stored as MIME files to bypass detection. MIME docs can have embedded malicious payloads or they can call out for payload. This signature simply looks at the file extension and the existence of HTML MIME objects. This kind of file may not be malicious, so the severity is set to informational.3) New filetype for VBScript for file blocking that you should look to block.I have customers who have already enabled the .js signatures in blocking mode.Examples for .js files :https://isc.sans.edu/forums/diary/Malicious+spam+with+zip+attachments+containing+js+files/20153/https://isc.sans.edu/forums/diary/TeslaCrypt+ransomware+sent+using+malicious+spam/20507/informational39002Javascript Sent in Emailalert5.0.0informational39003Javascript Sent in Emailalert7.0.0Content 557SeverityIDAttack NameCVE IDVendor IDDefault ActionMinimum PAN-OS Versioninformational38508HTML MIME Entities Masquerading As Word Documentsalert5.0.0New File Type (1)SeverityIDFile TypeMinimum PAN-OS Versionlow52114VBScript Encoded File5.0.0I hope this helps.",0,06-16-2017,09:13 PM
