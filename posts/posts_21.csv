Over the past year, we have developed many new features in Cloud Management that not only provide functional parity with Panorama for Prisma Access management but also offer many new capabilities that can only be delivered in the cloud. For existing customers wishing to switch from Panorama to Cloud Management, we have an in-product workflow that can be used to migrate your Prisma Access configuration. While this migration workflow is disabled by default, you can reach out to your account teams to enable this feature and begin the migration to Cloud Management.  Know that during this migration there is zero impact to your Prisma Access deployment and that you may continue using Panorama for NGFW management. Why move to Cloud Management:Here is the full set of features: https://docs.paloaltonetworks.com/prisma/prisma-access/prisma-access-cloud-managed-release-notes/rel...Here are the release notes: https://docs.paloaltonetworks.com/prisma/prisma-access/prisma-access-cloud-managed-release-notes/rel... This document provides you with the ability to compare features side by side and choose which platform is right for you. Please reach out and let us know your feedback",4,"

In case of HTTP Header insertion, are there any other SaaS applications outside of the predefined applications (Google, Dropbox, YouTube, and Office 365) that you are leveraging custom rules for?
