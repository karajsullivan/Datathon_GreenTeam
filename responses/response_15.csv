What Enterprise DLP is aiming to do is to provide a single DLP platform a across all products/platforms/workloads.You can configure and run Data Filtering profile on the Firewall withoutEnterprise DLP. WithEnterprise DLP you would gain a benefit of Advanced Data Filtering profile that has pre-defined a huge list of data patterns + all the cloud based analytics, however if you have only Firewall and no other product, then it might be overkill.Regarding your question whether Data Filtering is a part of Threat Prevention Subscription. All of my production Firewalls are running Threat Prevention, so personally I would not know, however I just looked into one of my lab Firewall that has no Threat Prevention license (only support is activated) and I can configure a Data Filtering profile and pull up all pre-defined Data Patterns, so I do not think thatThreat Prevention license is a must to getData Filtering up and running.Regarding your question whether Enterprise DLP requires Panorama, the answer is yes, one of the pre-requisite withEnterprise DLP is to have Firewall running at least 10.0.2 and be managed by Panorama.If you are seriously considering what option to choose, I would recommend to request demo ofEnterprise DLP and ideally get a trial to get more hands on test scenarios of data leak to see it is worth to invest.Kind RegardsPavel",0,05-13-2022,03:31 PM
