0,507893,AIOps For NGFW Discussions,vincent_hou,L0 Member,Feature Missing on AiOPS,"Hi All, After  telemetry is configured on FW and the status is success, then we can see Device Health/Health Alerts and other features on Summary Page, and we can have Insights information from Prisma Access (Cloud Management) which seams FW send raw telemetry successfully and CDL already receive the raw data from FW. But Network usage feature is  missing with ""something went wrong"" alert on Activity Dashboards. Besides, we can't see anything for DNS Sec Info. although we see it in autofocus. Did you experience same issue on Activity Dashboards? ",0,"

2,471995,AIOps For NGFW Discussions,svenkatarama,L2 Linker,Frequently encountered problems in Onboarding AIOps,"Problems with activating the Free tier of AIOps? In general, it is due to something trivial that has been overlooked. Based on our beta program, these were the top 3 reasons customers usually had issues in standing up an instance of the Free tier of AIOps. 1. During AIOps activation flow, there is no CDL tenant in the drop-down list to point to.If the customer is not already a Cortex Data Lake (CDL) logging service customer, a new telemetry-only CDL instance is created for them when telemetry from the first firewall appears. Telemetry generation and sending on the device's side is a batch process, and it may take as much as 2 hours from the time the user turns on telemetry on the PAN-OS 10.0+ device for the CDL instance to be created. Please check back in a little while to see if the instance exists.2. The ""Activate"" button is missing on the Hub (https://apps.paloaltonetworks.com) for the user. This hub requires the user to have App Admin privileges to enable the instantiation of the AIOps app. Please use the gear icon on the top right, under Manage Permissions to assign the user App Admin privileges to instantiate AIOps3. The firewall data is not showing up in the App.A few things could be happening here - we have seen customers hit these issues -",1,"

Please try again later"". then we have run the command ""debug swm unlock"" in CLI. After that when trying to install get an error as ""Error: findfs: unable to resolve 'LABEL=sysroot0' "".  when I have tried to view the ""debug swm status"" its showing as ""server error: Failed to execute the command"". Even i have tried to install PAN-OS from CLI still get the same error. i have tested by restarting the management server but still getting the same error. After checking some live community discussions, found we need to do a factory reset. But we are unable to do that, as the firewall is at a remote location so its difficult to get console access. Please suggest if any workarounds.",0,"
