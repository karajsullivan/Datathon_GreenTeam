3,302749,BrianHill,I don't have enough information to share with TAC yet. I will attempt to import the same firewall with shared-gateway again soon and collect a show tech and screenshots if it fails again (I did not do this before).My current assumption is that I just missed something in the import process during the last attempt.,0,02-13-2020,09:27 AM
4,302749,BrianHill,"So - Panorama does NOT fully support Shared-Gateways. You can import/create the shared gateway, assign it to Interfaces, but you cannot manage the NAT policy or the Forwarding policy.There is a feature request already --- FR ID:4412Additionally (maybe a bug), while attempting to import the policy into Panorama, I ran into an issue with named objects used as NAT translations. These had to be changed to IP addresses on the local firewall, then re-imported before a commit to Panorama would work. And yes, they were imported into shared.Also .... The shared-gateway NAT policy gets imported into the Panorama XML config. It can even be found by Global Search. Clicking on the names does nothing since there is no user interface to manage them.",0,03-10-2020,11:19 AM
5,302749,JimMcGrady,Has there been any progress with this issue? I'd like to include some NAT rules in a shared policy. But i cannot as each rule uses gateway specific IP addressing. And 'variables' cant be used in such rules.,0,07-14-2020,01:13 AM

18,496620,Astardzhiev,"Hi @MetgatzI see this post is about month old, but if you still interested in the anwser:- Force Template Value will as the name suggest remove any local configuratio and apply the value define the panorama template. But this is valid only for overlapping configuration. This means that if you define DNS and NTP servers in the template and at the same time you have local config for DNS and NTP if you push config from panorama, by default firewall will receive the template value, but it will still use the local. If you enable ""Force Template Value"", during Panorama push this will remove the local config and apply the DNS and NTP values defined in the template.It is important to remeber that this is valid only for overlapping configuration. Which also means that if your template is only defining DNS and NTP (and nothing else), but locally on your firewall you have HA and logging configuration, enabling ""Force Template Value"" will not remove local HA and Logging setting, because they don't overlapp with template definition.You need to be careful, what is actually defined in the template. For example - if you decide to enable HA in the template, but after that you decide to not push it with template and just disable it again (remove the check from the ""Enable HA"" checkbox). This still will be part of the template, because now your template is explicitely defining HA disabled. If you made a change in the template, and later decide that you don't want to control this setting with template, you need to revert the config by clicking the green bar next to the changed valueOr edit the template under CLI and use ""delete"" command to delete relevant config from the template.",0,07-07-2022,06:19 AM
19,502873,Astardzhiev,"Hi @treysgrun ,This shouldn't be happening. If overlapping configuration exist between local and panorama pushed, you should see green with yellow gear next to the object.

This should open the interface edit dialog, without changing anything click OK.- Check if now you see only one entry for that interface- Select the tunnel again and click ""Revert"" at the bottom.- You should see single entry with the green gear next to it.- Commit locally on the firewall.",0,07-07-2022,06:02 AM

23,506929,Mohanlalsaini,and i have the device state of the firewall before this duplicate config happened. Can I import this device state to remove the duplicate config.,0,06-28-2022,09:27 PM
24,506929,Astardzhiev,"Hi @Mohanlalsaini ,Let first discuss something fundamental - Templates vs Device Groups:- Device Groups are used to push objects and policies and security profiles. For example here you define address objecets and use them in security rules. Basically it is defining the firewall security functions- Templates are used to push device and networking configuration. For example what NTP and DNS should the device use and what IP addresses are assigned on the device.Panorama GUI is trying to help you to remember which settings where are managed by the brackets above the relevant tabs:Now you probably know this already, but it important to mention it, because there is fundamental difference between Templates and Device Groups about how they handel local configuration.- Device Groups - Even without Panorama (local fw config) you cannot have multiple object sharing the same name, or multiple rules/policies using the exact same name. This way firewall will not know who to handle the traffic (which object in which rule is used, or which rule is actually used). You still can create local rules and objects in case of emeregency - for example security engineer with access to panorama is not available, but local network engineer need to allow some traffic to solve user incident/request. The idea here is that your ""global policy"" pushed by the panorama could explicitly deny some traffic at the top of the policy, so no local rule will be able to be put at the top and bypass the global block rule.- Templates - none of the configuration defined in the template can have multiple values (you can have multiple hostnames, or multiple primary IPs on dataplane interfaces, etc), like with firewall rules. Which means if there is local config and config pushed from Panorama, firewall needs to choose which one to use. Now by default firewall will prefer the local configuration over the one pushed from Panorama. The idea behind this approach is that it is more common for local admin to override these settings. For example your panorama is pushing the IP assigned to the outside interface, but the ISP needs to change it, so the local network admin can override the config from panorama and apply the new IP. Another example is if your global policy define the use of specific NTP, but one specific site has issues and wants to use different one. One way to remove the local config and apply the panorama pushed is to go over each config and click on ""revert"" button. After that you need to commit locally on the firewall. This way will give you the option to review the configuration before commit, but it could be painful if there is a lot to revert.The other option would be to push template configuration from panorama, but this time enable ""Force Template Values"". This will force the firewall to remove any local configuration that is already defined in the template. Thi will not delete any local config that is not part of the template.Push to Device -> Edit Selection -> enable ""Force Template Values""",1,06-29-2022,01:47 PM

The syslog server:Live_Log_Collectors is configured in Template while log forwarding profile is configured under Device Group. The first thing I would try is to roll back the change and first push the Template Stack where you configured the syslog server:Live_Log_Collectors.

53,502932,avelK,"Thank you for the post@EarvinYuwhen it comes to secondary Panorama, the only concept that is supported is Panorama HA where 2 units are acting as either of the roles: primary-active / secondary-passive. If you built a standalone Panorama as your secondary appliance, the limitation you are going to face is a managed Firewall can be registered only to a single Panorama set at a time.Regarding the error you posted, it looks like you configured post policy security/nat rules with target Firewalls and Firewalls Serial Numbers are not in the configuration as registered Firewalls. Could you please confirm how you exported / import configuration? Based on my experience running configuration export includes everything including all Serial Numbers and there is no manual intervention needed to add Serial Numbers manually.Just in case, could you navigate to: Panorama > Setup > Operations > Export named Panorama configuration snapshot, then select: running-config.xml. Do not check: ""Select Device Group & Templates"". In this way full configuration will be exported. Edit the configuration file to change Panorama management interface IP address to new Panorama (Otherwise you will have IP address duplication) and change the name to avoid confusion. Login to other Panorama you built and navigate toPanorama > Setup > Operations > Import > Import named Panorama configuration snapshot, thenLoad configuration by going to: Panorama > Setup > Operations > Load > select file to load, then select only this option: ""Retain rule UUID"", then perform commit. After performing this step all configuration will be on one to one bases with your original Panorama.As closing note, even though I do not know exactly how you ended up in the state that configuration is imported with missing Firewall Serial Numbers, I believe that adding Serial Numbers manually fill fix the issue.

54,487516,avelK,"Thank you for the post@LRajangamWithout knowing details of your environment, my input might not be that valuable, however personally I would proceed with below steps for migration.1.) Perform hardware installation of PA-5220 including all the SFP modules. Perform initial configuration to bring management interface online and install all the licenses, PAN-OS upgrades, Application/Threat packages.2.) Since your PA-5220 is replacing existing Firewall, I assume it is going to be using identical configuration. In this case, I would place the new PA-5220 into the same Template Stack as the existing PA-5020. Depending on your Device Group hierarchy, I would do the same to place PA-5220 into the same Device Group. As a next step, I would push the configuration from Panorama to PA-5220, then if there is no issue I would plan actual cut over.3.) Before actual migration, I would pre-prepared all the cables and SFP modules. During the time of cut over, I would move cables one by one from old Firewall to new one. For the migration to new 40G connection, I would unplug cable from old Firewall and plug new 40G SFP connection to new Firewall. If there is no IP address change, then unless there is a physical connection issue / SFP issue or Fiber TX/RX swap, all should start to work with traffic being forwarded again. If traffic is not passing through even though all connections are up, I would check ARP table of switches on each side of the Firewall. In the case it is still pointing to MAC address of old Firewall, I would delete that entry and new ARP entry will be mapped to correct MAC address.Alternative way, would be to cable all the ports on PA-5220, but keep ports shut down on switch side to prevent IP address duplication. On the day of cut over just shut down ports on the switch facing old Firewall and un-shut ports facing new Firewall. This might be quicker than manually moving cables across.Regarding 3 points you mentioned, although I do not know details of vsys in DC and DR Firewalls, I do not think that this would make significant difference with the migration plan.Myself, I went through similar migration a few years ago from PA-5060 to PA-5260 in high pressure environment where only minimum downtime was allowed. Both old and new Firewalls were in HA (Active/Standby pair). I do not exactly recall sequence of all the steps we have done, but in nutshell we have pre-prepared all the configuration between old and new Firewall on one to one bases. We have pre-cabled everything, but kept ports shut down. On the day of cut over we shut down ports facing old switch and un-shut ports facing new switch. Since we had an HA pair, we had luxury to have more control which Firewall will forward traffic. The only issue we came across, the new Firewall did not send GARP which required manual intervention.At the beginning of your post, you mentioned about best practices. I would not call my write up a best practice, but rather experience sharing 🙂Kind RegardsPavel",0,06-09-2022,11:11 PM

Users told me about connection problems with GlobalProtect. By a look on the firewall I saw that the policies are missing, in the Panorama they were visible. I saw that there was an outstanding push on the Panorama, the preview showed that the policies I was missing should be applied to the location where they were missing. Very strange, because we just wanted to commit and push some shared objects to all locations. I pushed it and hoped it solves the problem.After the successful commit the policies still were not visible on the local device, just on the Panorama.I tried a reboot of the Panorama and a reboot of the local firewall device without any improvement.Both locations with same configuration were running one month without any problems after the firmware upgrade to 10.1.3, since today.For testing I tried to trigger a new push of polices by applying a new security policy (also by tag) to the device-group-level where the two locations get the other policies (applied by tag) from.After the commit and push the second location, which was running fine up to this moment, got the same problems as the other one, the policies (the old ones) were not visible on the local device anymore.

Create the Dedicated Logger profiles on Panorama FIRST - you only need to use the device serial number. Don't fill out anything else (yet).4.

When configs overlap, local config will be used, as long as it won't destroy integrity of machine config file - for example, when eth1/2 is used in other ae interfaces locally and in template - then whole commit will fail, so no changes will be applied. Remeber you have always ""Validate template push"" option in commit tab. You should export local config to Panorama, change it as you like and then push back. Second option is to manually rebuild local config on Panorama template, modify it and push. After successful commit, check if there any overriden settings locally on firewall and revert them - you will use then template settings.2)Of course after changing tempalte stack for firewall you need to push and commit new configuration. Mark ""Force Template Values"" in Push and Commit -> Push scope selection tab.

98,481211,benlewis,"After building a VM based lab and recreating the process I have discovered the root cause. Panorama 10.1.3+ has a new feature to support unique Master Keys for firewalls, Panorama, Log Collectors etc and during device config import into Panorama there is a field to enter a Master Key. This field is not documented in the 10.1 Panorama administrator guide at time of writing this.As a Master Key was never set I naturally left this field blank during the import which was the cause as Panorama no longer uses the well known default Master Key and therefore when pushing back to the firewall, passwords and pre-shared keys won't match.The fix is to enter the well known default Master Key when importing device config from firewalls where a Master Key has never been set. This ensures password and pre-shared key encryption strings are identical when pushing config back to the firewalls during the 'transition to Panorama' process.Hope this helps someone else!",1,04-19-2022,10:52 PM

119,454886,Darren_Schubert,"If the OP's situation and issue are like mine, the Panoramas (Primary-Active and Secondary/Passive) are in Panorama-mode -- meaning they function as Management and Log Collectors in what might be the only Collector Group. Whenever we upgrade the Panoramas -- we have a pair of M-600s, the ES cluster is red for 6-24 hrs... I think (and need to test this) the best method to avoid this is to stop the LCs on the Panoramas from taking in logs from the managed FWs just seconds before you begin the upgrade on the Secondary PAN -- the ES cluster appears to go red after the upgrade because the ES database on each PAN's LC is out of sync (for lack of a better word). If there is a way to disconnect the Managed Firewalls connections to the LCs, that is likely best overall -- they'll sit and queue locally on the FWs until they can connect to the LCs and forward them on. We've had 3-4 TAC cases about this and about the best advice they could provide was ... don't wait very long to begin the upgrade on the Primary Panorama once the Secondary is done -- the shorter the time period in which the ES cluster's nodes are out of sync, the less shards they have to process in order to get back into sync.

However in my case, on one the log collectors the ES cluster was struggling to come up (the output for commandshow log-collector-es-cluster health was empty or sometimes later cli was hanging or even one time crashed), at the end it took about 2 hours seeing the ES cluster to come up on that LC (show log-collector-es-cluster health worked fine for the first time and showed the expected outputs) and also at this time the FW logs started coming into Panorama. For my case all FWs immediately after the upgrades got connections to LC according to ""show logging-status device xxx.

I was able to complete the push and commit however anything that uses a password or secret such as a IKE Gateway pre-shared key didn't work. The resultant outage was significant with over 100 IPSec VPN's configured so I quickly reverted the 3250's to their original device state.I suspected someone had set a new Master Key however that wasn't the case. I then compared the encrypted values for passwords and pre-shared keys between firewalls and Panorama and they were indeed different. I know Panorama 10.1.3 doesn't support firewalls running 10.1.0 - 10.1.2 (Panorama Admin Guide) however I can't find official word that 10.0.X isn't supported either.Downgrading isn't really an option as 10.0 becomes end of life in July this year so next step is trying the process again with an eval VM running 10.0.8-h4 loaded with very similar config to the 3250's and see if the same result occurs. Following on from that I will upgrade Panorama and the VM to 10.1.5-h1 to see if the issue is resolved.I have another 15 x 440's on Satellite links to migrate so need to make sure the process is error free.",0,04-13-2022,03:08 PM

In this scenario, the only option is to configure new M-200 as a dedicated log collector:https://docs.paloaltonetworks.com/panorama/10-1/panorama-admin/manage-log-collection/log-collection-...Since you are using Panorama HA with built in log collectors, there is no option to expend it unless you configure the new M-200 in logger mode and register it to existing Panorama as a dedicated log collector.2.) Technically the only requirement to add a new log collector to existing log collector group is to have the same hardware which you have. After you register new M-200 to Panorama, you should be able to add it to log collector group under: Panorama > Collector Groups > [Log Collector Group Name] > Collector Group Members > Add3.) Adding new M-200 will increase capacity, but keep in mind a few points:- By having the option: ""Enable log redundancy across collectors"" enabled, a single log will be stored in 2 different log collectors. Please refer to the: ""Log Redundancy"" in this link:https://knowledgebase.paloaltonetworks.com/KCSArticleDetail?id=kA14u000000HBw7CAG- New log collector will have this portion of the log:https://knowledgebase.paloaltonetworks.com/KCSArticleDetail?id=kA10g000000PPcwCAG-After you add Log Collectors to an existing Collector Group, Panorama redistributes its existing logs across all the Log Collectors, which can take hours for each terabyte of logs. During the redistribution process, the maximum logging rate is reduced. In the Panorama Collector Groups page, the Log Redistribution State column indicates the completion status of the process as a percentage.4.) The logs will be ingested by new log collector depending on how you set up device log forwarding in log collector group, then actual log will be stored in 2 log collectors across log collector group by using internal algorithm.5.) I think, I answered this by above 4 points, but if there is any question, I will try on best effort bases help.Kind RegardsPavel Kucera",1,03-13-2022,04:28 PM
168,472190,Deepak25,"Hi @PavelK,Thanks for help.I have go through shared KB's but still have some queries regarding log redistribution when Collector group having three log collectors.1. In current setup for location A firewalls (2 HA pair) - primary LC is location A panorama LC and secondary LC is location B panorama LC in log forwarding preference. Same for location B firewalls (2 HA pair) - primary LC is location B panorama LC and secondary LC is location A panorama LC in log forwarding preference.- What is the best option to add third LC in log forwarding preference list in order to utilize its space for logging. Do we add new LC as a tertiary in existing log forwarding preference lists or we should create new log forwarding preference list for some firewalls from the list and keep new LC as a primary and others as secondary , tertiary.2. Currently we have configured Location A Panorama as primary and location B panorama as secondary in all locations firewall devices. Does this setting is effective only in case of firewall management when Panorama is in HA. Because as we are adding new LC in logger mode in existing LC group of Panorama where built in LC's also added , how firewalls will forward the log to this third LC if we keep this as a primary in log forwarding preference list for some firewall. As we are not mentioning third LC ip in panorama setting of firewalls.3. In log forwarding preference , if primary LC is full does the log store to secondary LC. and if secondary LC is full does it store to tertiary LC. 4. Currently in both LC's in collector group is full and logs are purging after every five days.So after adding third LC in collector group after redistribution, disk quota of LC1 and LC2 will reduce ? will it lower down from 100 % utilization.",0,03-16-2022,05:47 AM
169,472190,avelK,"Thank you for reply@Deepak251.) Personally I would advice to go with this option: ""Create new log forwarding preference list for some firewalls from the list and keep new LC as a primary and others as secondary , tertiary."" The log forwarding preference only defines which log collector ingests the logs, but the log location among log collectors in the same log collector group is determined by hash algorithm, so the logs do not necessarily have to reside in the first log collector in log forwarding preference list. Full details are provided in this article:https://docs.paloaltonetworks.com/panorama/9-1/panorama-admin/panorama-overview/centralized-logging-...2.) You do not have to modify this setting. On the Firewall side, you configure only Panorama Manager IP address (Primary and Secondary in the case of HA), so you can keep this setting as it is after you bring 3rd log collector online. The Firewall will learn log forwarding preference after it is registered to Panorama Manager.3.) The answer to this question is provided in the link, I shared in the point no.1. Basically, all log collectors in the same log collector group are working as one storage and all log collectors are storing logs. When it comes to enabling log redundancy across log collectors, there is one caveat:Log redundancy is available only if each Log Collector has the same number of logging disks.4.) I do not have confidence to answer this question without knowing your environment, however the disk quota is configuration that will not change by adding new log collector. For actual utilization, by adding 3rd log collector, you will get more storage, but if you have a lot of logs, you will eventually reach 100% utilization, but you will have longer retention period.There is one more point that I forgot to mention in my earlier post, for log collector you will need this license:https://knowledgebase.paloaltonetworks.com/KCSArticleDetail?id=kA10g000000PNu0CAG&lang=en_US%E2%80%A...Kind RegardsPavel",0,03-17-2022,03:53 PM

During the upgrade from 9.1 to 10.0 every single log file on the M-600 has to be migrated, so the more logs a system has the longer the process is going to take. I've seen some updates take upwards of 5 hours.Maintenance updates are much quicker because you don't have to do anything to migrate the logs, as they are all already in the proper format.Also I'd also put out that I personally wouldn't recommend upgrading your M-600 (presumably functioning in Panorama mode) and your firewalls at the same time. If you run into a bug or issue post upgrade and need to downgrade your M-600 you would also need to downgrade your PA-5220s at the same time so they can be managed by Panorama.I would recommend upgrading Panorama the week prior to upgrading any of your firewalls.

After this step is done, you might have to make some changes in Template to match interfaces of 5450 as hardware of 5060 is different than 5450. After this step if there is no validation error, you can push Device Group and Template Stack to 5450 and have it all managed by Panorama.Kind RegardsPavel",0,01-27-2022,03:54 PM

Anyway, I tried removing the new Vsys6 and the configs created with it on the PAN and tried to push it to the local FW box. the push still failed but only the device group portion. So we decided to un-pair the FW from PAN but instead of checking the import ""device and network template"" and the ""policy and object"" checkbox.we decided to only keep the local default settings ""local admin"" ,""management port"" etc. after UN-pairing we didnt commit the change on the local box. instead we went straight to re-pairing the FW back to PAN, added it back to the device groups. did a ""commit and push"" and that was successful. when into the local FW and everything matches up now.

Seems like an overly complicated, round-about way compared to making the ""enabled"" tag override-able. 🙂 Wonder what the Policies tab --> Security Policies --> Post page would look like?

Or have to use the ""Preview Rules"" button to see what will actually get pushed to the firewall?Still think having the enable/disable toggle work in child device groups is a better/cleaner solution. 🙂(Could also be that our device group hierarchy isn't ideal and there's better ways to arrange things.

As we add those devices to more sites, we add them to the target list. Eventually (hopefully), that list grows to include all Child Device Groups and it switches over to ""any"".Neat. I think this will actually work. Was wondering what the Target tab was for, as I couldn't see a reason for targetting rules to only specific child device groups, but now it (mostly) makes sense!Thanks for the pointer! I will have to play with this a bit to see if this will do what I want it to do.And, I think this will actually help to clean up our one firewall that has completely different Security Policies compared to every other site, so it has an (essentially) duplicated ruleset done in the lowest device group (local to the firewall) with a ""Deny all"" rule to short-circuit the inherited rules from parent device groups.",1,12-09-2021,04:26 PM

331,258256,campo,"Same issue. Which is causing administrative headaches with template stack scheme design, just as the OP stated in their environment.If I am understanding@BatD's response ""even though it looks the oposite in GUI, in the actuall XML file you are adding interfaces to a zone, rather than applying zone to an interface"", they are saying that in the underlying firewall configuration (the XML), interfaces get added to zones, not the other way around. So, in the GUI, we can create or edit the zone and add interfaces to it (which I always thought was an odd way to do it), OR we can go to an interface and add it to a zone (more sense to me). But the later is a feature of the GUI for administrator convenience and not the way it actually works under the hood. So, when a zone exists in Template A, it's interface assignments also exist in Template A. When you create and manage interfaces in template B, only the zones from Template B will be available for use... because there is nothing in Template B (where the interface is configured) that can ""assign it"" to a zone since it is in the zone configuration itself where interface-to-zone assignments live. Wherever the zone exists, the interfaces assigned to it must also exist.So the crux of this boils down to the problem of having a zone that is configured to have member interfaces that don't exist, which I suppose is a different/worse problem than having a security policy with a non-existent zone as source/destination?How very vexing.Certainly, I don't think I've ever met a firewall engineer or administrator who tended to thinks of zones having interfaces as part of defining that zone, rather than zone membership being a property of an interface that you would define in the interface. Is there any good reason for this being so? Like any security or technical justification for not doing it the other way? Very curious of how this is affected by deeper considerations.This reminds me of how VLAN assignments are handled in switches by different vendors. Some platforms have interfaces assigned to a VLAN only from the context of configuring that VLAN (you add the interface members of a VLAN as part of defining the VLAN), whereas other NOS's have you go into the interface and configure it's VLAN memberships and tagging as property of that interface.From an administrative point of view, though... it is a royal pain to have to keep zones and interfaces configured in the same templates and kind of defeats the point of stacking hierarchy. I think most people will tend to want to do just this: globally define all possible zones, then assign those zones when and where they are used (at lower levels).",0,11-05-2021,08:59 AM

On a firewall with the default single vsys, the certificates and SSL/TLS service profiles are stored in shared, although you cannot see or set the location in the GUI. You can see it in the CLI with the ""show shared certificate"" and ""show shared ssl-tls-service-profile"" commands. So, on the single-vsys NGFW, you can only choose SSL/TLS service profiles in shared from Device > Setup > Management. I first noticed this behavior on a multi-vsys firewall. It seems to be built in and cannot be set to choose from vsys1, possibly because PANW does not want device management config tied to a vsys.Thanks,Tom",0,11-09-2021,07:02 PM

Unfortunately there is no other way around except deleting it or renaming.I can't really say what the best practice is, but there are only 2 options.Either onboard new Firewall. Here is corresponding Best Practice Link:https://docs.paloaltonetworks.com/best-practices/10-1/best-practices-for-managing-firewalls-with-pan...Or migrate existing Firewall by importing configuration to Panorama and pushing it back to Firewall. Here is corresponding Best Practice:https://docs.paloaltonetworks.com/best-practices/10-1/best-practices-for-managing-firewalls-with-pan...In my case when we deployed Panorama we already had several Firewalls deployed in production and despite the fact there was an option to migrate Firewall to Panorama by importing configuration, I opted for onboarding it as a new Firewall then I pushed all the configuration from Device Group and Template Stack and deleted all local configuration as far as I could. What I personally did not like about importing existing configuration were 2 things:- Local configuration was already messy and not following any convention, so I did not want to import messy configuration and turn it into Device Group/Template.- I wanted to avoid issue you posted here that by importing I need to resolve several issue first. Also, I was afraid of merging of config and forcing of Template Values especially for critical Firewalls.By pushing new configuration by Panorama with different naming convention than local configuration has avoided any configuration duplication. This approach has still several disadvantages. It is time consuming to clean up all local configuration and unless I select: ""Force Template Values"" most of the configuration is pushed but not applied unless I override it and commit it locally. At this moment I have under Panorama over 150+ Firewalls and I used the same approach regardless it is brand new device or existing one that I turned into Panorama managed. We have decided not to use Panorama for interface configuration and routing. This is what we manage locally as we would like to have more control and avoid operational mistakes by pushing something centrally that will break control plane.If you have greenfield deployment I would leverage Panorama as much as you can. Unless you are concerned about some of the points I mentioned I do not discourage you to use import of local configuration to Panorama and pushing it back. I know many admins that use it successfully in their deployments.Kind RegardsPavel",0,10-15-2021,12:09 AM

If you are looking into importing Firewall configuration into Panorama and pushing Device Group / Template created based in imported configuration, then here is corresponding KB:https://knowledgebase.paloaltonetworks.com/KCSArticleDetail?id=kA10g000000ClZSCA0When it comes to precautions, on the top of my head I can think of these points:- Panorama should be running the same or higher PAN-OS version than Firewall.- If Firewall is configured for HA refer to this KB:https://knowledgebase.paloaltonetworks.com/kcsArticleDetail?id=kA10g000000PNG0- If you are going to reuse Device Group that is referring to any built in EDL and push it to Firewall that does not have Threat License, it will fail.Alternative way to importing configuration to Panorama, would be to create a new Device Group + Template/Template stack, associate Firewall withDevice Group and Template Stack and then push the configuration to Firewall. As long as the objects are using unique names and not duplicated with local configuration it will work, however drawback with this approach, ideally you want to clean up local configuration.

368,442048,avelK,"Thank you for posting question@perumalj1. Both options are possible. If Firewall is managed by Panorama it is not must to upgrade Firewall by Panorama, you can upgrade it locally as well.2. Once Firewall is registered in Panorama, the configuration is backup up automatically after each commit. You can check it from: Panorama > Managed Devices > Summary > Backups > Manage > Committed Configurations, however I recommend to take configuration backup manually from Firewall by going to: Device > Setup > Operations > Export named configuration snapshot > running-config.xml3. Both options are possible.If Firewall is managed by Panorama it is not must to push content update by Panorama. You can let each of the Firewall to download it directly from Palo Alto, however if there is use case that Firewall does not have access to Internet to download the content update, pushing it from Panorama would be the way around it.4. You can roll both locally from Firewall. In the case of emergency, here is the KB:https://knowledgebase.paloaltonetworks.com/KCSArticleDetail?id=kA10g000000ClcYCAS5.

Regarding staging, I personally upgrade Panorama first, then I choose one of the Firewall that is not critical and upgrade it to the same version and observe it for a few days, then follow up with upgrade for other Firewalls.6.

Below are my findings:When I tried to change Firewalls management interface IP address locally on the Firewall, after I committed changes, the Panorama's Automatic Connection Recovery has kicked in and rolled back the change to the original IP address.On the second attempt, I disabled thePanorama's Automatic Connection Recovery feature from: Device > Setup > Management > Panorama Settings > [De-select] Enable automated commit recovery, then I tried again to change IP address and after commit was completed it worked well. After approximately 2 minutes, I have seen the Firewall in Panorama with new management IP address.You might have to restart management process on Firewall to restart log sending if you are using Panorama also for log collection. After this change, I have not seen any issue with Firewalls Device Group / Template Stack.

406,436065,avelK,"Thank you for posting your questions@Mohamed_Haneef1.)I assume that you are using Panorama with local Log Collector. Even though Panorama has Active and Passive status for management functions, the log collectors process incoming logs from Firewalls regardless of the Active / Passive status. Depending on how you configured Device Log Forwarding Preferences each of the Log Collector can be ingesting different logs, then if you configure Syslog under Collector Log Forwarding, you might be seeing that Log Collector running on Passive Panorama node might actually be sending more logs to 3rd party system than your Active Panorama node. You can verify current log rate status by going to: Panorama > Managed Collectors > Statistics > Performance (Average Logs/sec). If you in the future build dedicated Log Collector, then it will be dedicated Log Collector sending logs to 3rd party system and not Panorama Manager.2.)To be honest, I never looked into this, but only for comparison I checked a few Log Collectors and I can also see: ""syslog dropped count"" is high, but in you case itdoes not sound healthy. Are you seeing anything unusual in the System Log? You can use filter:( subtype eq syslog ).3.)Could you go to: Panorama > Collector Groups > [Log Collector Name] > Log Storage >Detailed Firewall Logs and check your allocated quota?

These firewalls are either given as a list of IP addresses on the command line or given in a YAML inventory file. You can run the sli mass_ssh --help command to see examples of both the inputted script file and the YAML inventory file.mass_ssh_from_panorama does the same thing except it gathers the NGFW list from a Panorama device. SLI will grab a list of all connected devices for a given Panorama device and then will optionally filter based on an inputted dictionary of key values.

463,428528,SteveCantwell,"Hi thereYou appear to be running an out of support version of software with the 7.xIs there a reason why your company has not upgraded in nearly 7 years? Just more of a curiosity on this one. 😛As far as Panorama, can you please provide information on your need/requirement to change from Legacy to Panorama mode?I believe Panorama mode was supported in 8.1.x software (and if you are running in 7.x) then maybe (not sure) this could be a symptom.For upgrading the VM Panorama, you would need to have a valid maintenance contract, and go through getting the latest Dynamic Updates, and then upgrade from 7.x to 8.0 (reboot), from 8.0 to 8.1, then to 9.0, then 9.1, with reboots after every major version.In the alternative (if you have a maintenance contract) you could also download a FRESH 9.1 image, get it up and running, and then export your older config, then import into the new Panorama.Hope this helps.What additional questions can we answer for you?",0,08-24-2021,08:46 AM
464,428528,MikeC,"@SteveCantwellsorry for the confusion. My Panorama is actually running 9.0.12. I switched to panorama mode from legacy, because I'm planning to upgrade to 10.x. It was my understanding that legacy mode was not supported in 9.1(+above). Palo documentation states they do not recommend legacy mode.I'm running the Panorama VM on esxi 6.7, but the virtual machine hardware version is 7 (vmx-07).  This is from when it was originally deployed. The problem is VM hardware vmx-07 has a max CPU of 8. What I'm not clear on is if I can upgrade the hardware version of the VM to vmx-10. If I can't increase the hardware version, then I can't increase the CPU.As you stated, one option is to deploy a new OVA and restore config. The issue I have with that is, it seems like this would be something that have to continue to happen, as years go by. As I'm sure you are aware, every time you do this, you lose all your logs. Seems like there should be an easier way",0,08-25-2021,06:23 PM

The cached user-id entries will still be present until their age-out limit is reached, you simply won't be able to get any updates until the commit with the updated password is actually applied. So yes that's a disruption, but not a ""everything stopped working because we dropped the entire user-id database"" disruption.On to your other question, it would technically be quicker to push the change directly at the device instead of pushing it through Panorama. You aren't talking about a huge amount of time difference however. Whenever you're automating anything on the firewall Idon'trecommend doing it through a CLI script. The API is the easier option, is actually built for these sort of situations, and will allow you to easily build out a pretty robust script with built in job status and failure detection.Once you have the script operational just be mindful that you'll want to run the commit on all devices in parallel if you actually want to see a performance improvements over Panorama.
