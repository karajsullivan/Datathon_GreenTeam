2,504478,gallagher,"Hi Suresh, there are no known issues that I am aware of, but would need more info to assist:1) Can you provide more info on what exactly is not working with your NAT?2) The ION1000 does support dot1q on LAN interfaces, what is the issue you're facing?",0,06-21-2022,06:19 AM
3,504478,SureshM,"1)NAT issuewe have seen instances that the direct internet traffic for applications like zoom is not getting exiting from the appliance . On further troubleshooting , found the NAT translations are not happening . To fix the issue , the box need to rebooted .2) Dot1q issueWHen we configure more than 5 or 6 dot1q interfaces , many end host is loosing connection to the gateway . The Arp is not getting completed . So whenever we do a deployment , do limited to number of dot1q interfaces creating on the device",0,06-28-2022,08:35 PM
4,504478,gallagher,"Suresh, what code are you running on the IONs? Neither of these are expected behaviors, if a code upgrade does not address them then please raise a support ticket and have them investigated.",0,06-29-2022,06:57 AM
5,492612,gallagher,"For virtual HA designs it's preferable not to use bypass pairs (given there is no hw bypass support), instead each WAN interface should have it's own unique IP address to avoid IP address conflicts. The rest of the design on the LAN side can be the same as a normal HA design.",1,06-14-2022,11:46 AM

8,497342,avelK,"Thank you for the post@TKlausen2maybe there is a better way to do it, but on top of my head I can think of below options:Advertising router ID / AS numberLogin to SD-WAN portal, then navigate to: Maps > Claimed Devices, then click on any appliance, then a new page will open:After you click on remote session, a new page will open where you can login from CLI. Authenticate with elem-admin, then issue: ""dump routing route prefix=X.X.X.X/32"" where X.X.X.X is the prefix you are tracking down. Reference is here:https://docs.paloaltonetworks.com/prisma/prisma-sd-wan/prisma-sd-wan-ion-cli-reference/use-cli-comma... In this output, you will see the router ID as well as AS of the device that advertised that prefix:If you know to what router/site that router ID / AS number belongs, then you go to that site and fix it. If you do not know that information, you can still find it from SD-WAN portal from:Manage > Setup > Devices > Claimed > Select a device > Routing > BGP/Peers > BGP Global Config for ION device. If you have hundreds of devices, this might however be a time consuming and equals to searching that slider misconfiguration manually device by device.Audit LogAn alternative way might be to search in audit log to track down recent changes.

9,497342,kn,From the DC device try the below commands#dump prefix reachability prefix=x.x.x.x/32this will give you path id from which its learning the prefixes and then try#inspect fib vpn pathid=zzzzzzzzzzthe above command will give you the site name. |,1,06-13-2022,11:32 PM

11,426808,vsys_remo,"Hi @Amin2Generally Prisma means a cloudservice by Paloalto. So in this case here Prisma SD-WAN is the SD-WAN technology (formerly Cloudgenix which was aquired by Paloaltonetworks) based on ION devices. These devices are configured with a cloudservice from Paloalto. To these devices you can connect various WAN links like MPLS, LTE and so on. By policies configured in the cloud the best path will be chosen for specific traffic to be sent to your main datacenter where you need an ION-7000 or ION-9000. These ION devices are only for the SD-WAN part. They also analyze traffic to forward it to the right configured path but these are not actual firewalls. Paloalto SD-WAN is SD-WAN for Paloalto firewalls. So in addition to the best in class network security that you get with a Paloaltonetworks firewall, this subscription also enables the SD-WAN technology where you can add different WAN links to the firewall and configure them to be used all at the same time for different types of traffic including the dynamic setup of VPN tunnels (like with the ION devices) between your locations. The configuration of the Paloalto SD-WAN is not done locally on the firewalls or with panorama and not with the cloudservice.",0,08-14-2021,10:05 AM

13,457665,avelK,"Thank you for the post@AjitKumarBased on the output you provided the IOS appliance has connectivity to portal. In order to see what is preventing from registration, I would recommend to run: ""debug controller reachability controller1""The device that can successfully register will have below output:ion toolkit# debug controller reachability controller1TPM and tcsd process is running fineMic cert check passedCic cert check passedMic cert verify passedCic cert verify passedCIC cert connection test doneDevice is connected to ControllerThe first thing that has to pass is MIC (Manufacturer Installed Certificate) check to authenticate ION appliance to controller. If it fails at this step, could you confirm the certificate is there and that it is valid: ""inspect certificate mic""Below KB describes steps during initial to portal:https://knowledgebase.paloaltonetworks.com/KCSArticleDetail?id=kA14u000000HBNHCA4Depending which step fails in the debug and validity of certificate, I would narrow down the troubleshooting.Kind RegardsPavel",0,01-14-2022,12:06 AM
14,457243,avelK,"Thank you for the post@AjitKumarION appliance will register to portal via ""controller 1"" interface.

18,457243,avelK,"Thank you for reply@AjitKumarBased on debug output you provided, it looks like that the MIC (Manufacturer Installed Certificate) is missing/invalid. During the initial registration, the CloudGenix controller validates the ION's MIC, which is stored in the TPM. This is however failing. This is likely reason why you can't see this ION under unclaimed devices in portal. At this point, I would reach Palo Alto support. I do not believe this is something you can fix by your self.Kind RegardsPavel",0,01-10-2022,05:43 AM
