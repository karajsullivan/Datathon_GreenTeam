3,507484,VM-Series in the Private Cloud,Sec101,L4 Transporter,"Vcenter plugin, Notify Groups, Inherited address objects, and matching","In working with the panorama vcenter plugin, I've noticed unexpected results when panorama uses inherited ancestor address group objects when trying to pull vcenter tag matches.   It appears if the object is in the local device group, panorama populates dynamic tags, address objects into the group, and everything works. When using inherited address groups (notify group is mapped to descendant), panorama will no longer populate the dynamic tags from vcenter, nor will it show the actual addresses.   However, the firewalls still receive the mappings normally, and updates as expected.  It makes it impossible to search/match when the address group is at a higher level, but if you get the matches right (manually type the vcenter path), it appears to populate the firewalls as expected. Wondering if there is some mapping on the backend of panorama that isn't populating, or if the plugin is expecting everything to be at a single device group level?Any feedback/experiences with this?",0,"

No load balancer.>The firewall has static routes in place (in a single virtual router) to the 'router' address of each subnet on the hosting VNets.

Nothing gets through or re-routed though - I have tried with and without a noNAT to make sure that wasn't the issue.>A packet capture reveals the firewall sending ARPs for the address of the subnet router addresses - but cannot see if it gets a reply. So what do we think is happening here? It's like the firewall isn't able to reach the router address in the subnet, even though I can see that it can.Have I missed something? Asymmetric routing perhaps?  ",0,"

10,475385,VM-Series in the Private Cloud,palomed,L3 Networker,Making a VM300 GP Gateway Available to the Internet,"I know have a VM300 NGFW installed and registered in my private vCenter environment. The reason for the VM300 is to provide more Global Protect users a means to connect to the network than the 1024 connections afforded by the 3220 PAN at the edge. My question has to do with addressing and zoning of the interfaces on the VM300 and NATting to the Internet.  1) Can I add a 1:1 NAT on the 3220 that would map to the ""OUTSIDE"" of the VM300 (which is inside the PAN 3220)? So say currently the outside address of the 3220 is 1.1.1.100 and that serves as the address for the existing portal and gateway too. We'll say the inside of the PAN 3220 is at 10.10.10.100. If we made the ""Outside"" of the of the VM300 to be at say 10.10.10.200, could we create a NAT on the 3220 such that 1.1.1.200 NATted to 10.10.10.200 and have this work for the purposes of a GP gateway? 2) Would it be preferable for the VM300 to have it's OUTSIDE interface on a DMZ VLAN off of the 3220 and then have its inside interface be placed on the internal network? So in this scenario the VM300 OUTSIDE interface has IP 10.10.20.200 and that NATs to 1.1.1.200 on the 3220 OUTSIDE. To summarize: Can one hardware PAN serve as the NAT and routing conduit to and internal VM PAN that will act as a secondary GP gateway to the former? And what would be the preferred layout of the interfaces of the VM PAN in such a scenario? Thank you.",0,"

12,473809,VM-Series in the Private Cloud,BernardGoh,L0 Member,Palo Alto VM300 is not responding to the incoming IKE_SA_INIT request,"Hi there,   I am experiencing a weird behavior of my VM-Series PA running PanOS 10.0.4   I am trying to construct 2 VPN tunnels. First tunnel is IKEv1 toward CiscoASA. This tunnel is up and running like a charm.   However, my second tunnel toward a Google Cloud VPN, using IKEv2, my PA is ignoring the IKE_SA_INIT from the Google.   I have check all configuration are good and matched on both end. The following is puzzling me.   1) I used Packet Capture (GUI) to capture the raw packets and examine the traffic using Wireshark. I am able to see the incoming IKE_SA_INIT request from Google addressing to my PA IP at UDP port 500. But, there is no single reply from PA. It is like unidirectional traffic, I have ensured my filter is monitoring both way because I can see traffic toward Cisco ASA in the capture.    2) I then turned on the ike debug by running ""debug ike global on debug"" and ""tail follow yes mp-log ikemgr.log"". To my surprise, I did not see any IKE_SA_INIT from Google in the log. Note : I can see the detail transaction from Cisco ASA.    3) I then turned on the pcap debug by using ""debug ike pcap on"" and use ""view-pcap no-dns-lookup yes no-port-lookup yes follow yes debug-pcap ikemgr.pcap"" . Again, I can't see any traffic from Google. The Google is sending the IKE_SA_INIT repeatedly. But I can't see even a single one.   I am wondering if anyone have any clue about this weird behavior? p/s : I noticed in the wire-shark that the same INIT was also forwarded to an IP in my INT zone where 10.128.140.69 is my EXT IP and 10.128.140.160 is my app server (proxy id) sitting in INT zone which can't be reach from internet. Why am I see that packet?  RegardsBernard",0,"

I use certificate based authentication. The server certificate on the existing firewall is gp.acme.com - would this same certificate go onto the new gateway as well?
