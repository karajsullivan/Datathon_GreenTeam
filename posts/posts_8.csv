3,436846,CN-Series Discussions,jochristian,L2 Linker,Workload Identity,"Hi,Does the CN-series firewalls support Kubernetes cluster with Workload Identity enabled?https://cloud.google.com/kubernetes-engine/docs/how-to/workload-identitySeveral reasons for asking. Main reasons being.* Cluster security is changed.* -workload-metadata=GKE_METADATA need to be enabled. This means that the cluster will prevent workloads from using the Compute Engine service account. Do we need to change the yml scripts maybe?If supported I would also like to know if upgraded an k8s cluster with CN series already installed is supported.  /Jo Christian",1,"

Been wrestling with these babies for a while now and have read PA-CTNR unsupported platform guide back to front , back to front and side to side a lot of time !!!!!I have the container firewalls up and running , licensed , passing traffic .  Problem is with updates - I have sent a template to the firewalls with  a confirmation to retrieve updates. I get the following errors :I do seem to be able to update the  version from Panorama dynamic updates - I see completion but version does not increase . I true Palo Fashion there is no documentation .  The CN firewalls are licenced correctly. Anyone see this or can they help ? Ta     ",0,"

6,413226,CN-Series Discussions,civilised,L1 Bithead,CN - Firewalls - Upgrade Sequence,So you have successfully updated container images  for pan-mgmt-sts and pan-ngfw.  However when you updates the CNI images ngfw pods stop being able to talk . Tried applying all and restarting all pods and it still fails.  CNI 1.0.4 seems to be incompatible with 10.0.6.... Again no clues in release notes or no documentation... Can anyone help ? ,0,"

7,373622,CN-Series Discussions,apatil,L3 Networker,Why would I need a CN-Series if I have a VM-Series?,"Both VM-Series and CN-Series firewalls can be used to protect container environments. The major difference between the two is the granularity of visibility and control delivered by the CN-Series. VM-Series firewalls can enforce cluster-level security policies, which makes them good for basic perimeter security of an entire cluster. But in many circumstances, you may want to inspect traffic within the cluster for threats or for compliance reasons, or you might want to enforce tighter segmentation between application components hosted within the same cluster. In these circumstances, CN-Series firewalls provide the granular visibility and control over traffic between nodes that will enable these types of use cases. Learn more here.",2,"

8,373609,CN-Series Discussions,apatil,L3 Networker,What is the difference between a container firewall and a virtual firewall?,"As their names suggest, the major difference between a container firewall and a virtual firewall is the fact that container firewalls are deployed as containerized services and virtual firewalls are deployed as virtual machines. By deploying as a container, container firewalls are more easily integrated into containerized environments, giving them deeper visibility and control over the traffic that traverses the container environment. Their deployment can also be orchestrated using the native tools for managing containerized environments, allowing them to be easily incorporated into existing DevOps workflows. Virtual firewalls are better suited for deployment into virtualized environments, including public and private clouds. They can be used to enforce perimeter security in public clouds as well as for segmentation to inspect east-west traffic for threats. Learn more here.",0,"
