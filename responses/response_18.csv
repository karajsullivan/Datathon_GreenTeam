24,484658,Kevin-OHare,Its happening for alot of Prisma users on different clients from 5.2.4 up to 5.2.10 so i know its not the client softwareNot all users are affected but the ones that are affected can get around the issue by disabling their wifi to disrupt the Pre-logon tunnel and then turn their wifi back on and it reconnects to the domain via Prisma. Its very frustrating and i would just like to know why this is happening. Is it something that has been pushed out on windows 10 or is it a problem with Pre-logonany advice is welcome,0,05-09-2022,01:54 PM
25,484658,Kevin-OHare,That is true and this has been working ok for two years but now random users are having a logon issue. Is as if their laptop is trying to talk to the internet when the pre-tunnel is loading. I think i have tracked it down to the following sites and i now have a rule at the top of the policy for pre-logon to hit these websites. Then it disconnects and reconnects the user from Prisma to our domain. It seems to work ok for now but why does the windows 10 laptop need access to these websites. Does that not defeat the purpose of pre-tunnel which should only talk to our domain controllers before disconnecting and then reconnecting to log the user inautologon.microsoftazuread-sso.com/domain.com/*.microsoft.com/www.bing.com/login.live.com/*.data.microsoft.com/*.msn.com,0,05-09-2022,01:59 PM

You can may be ask for more details from TAC on why the process is crashing and also involve local IT team or microsoft as applicable to identify what process is causing the crash.

34,480592,nikoolayy1,"Why would you need a firewall at the branch when you have ipsec or gre tunnel to prisma access? Any router can create this tunnel.Better consider that Prisma Access autoscales when you have more traffic for example more mobile users are working at home at one day and at the other day less mobile users are working from home. Also Palo Alto firewalls are great but even they can get overutilized expecially the older models when you are doing ssl decryption but Prisma Access will handle this. Also for mobile workers from home sending all the traffic to the on-prem firewall can make issues as I mentioned as bandwidth, firewall cpu/memory etc. and many times a split tunnel is used that can cause security risks if users are allowed to go Internet without any security but with prisma access and the globalprotect agent all the user traffic can go through VPN to Prisma Access and be scanned or if you have on-prem firewalls and VPN you can use Prisma Access Explicit Proxy mode to send only the Internet web traffic to Prisma Access and the other traffic with VPN split tunnel can go to the on-prem firewalls.https://docs.paloaltonetworks.com/prisma/prisma-access/prisma-access-panorama-admin/prisma-access-fo...https://docs.paloaltonetworks.com/prisma/prisma-access/prisma-access-panorama-admin/prisma-access-fo...https://docs.paloaltonetworks.com/prisma/prisma-access/prisma-access-panorama-admin/prisma-access-fo...Also as it is firewall as a service you don't handle upgrades of the infrastructure as Palo Alto handles this.Also Prisma Access/Sase has some nice features like ADEM for user expiriance to discover network issues or SD-WAN as you can have Prisma Access ION devices on-prem to connect you to the Prisma Access:https://www.paloaltonetworks.com/sase/ademhttps://docs.paloaltonetworks.com/prisma/prisma-sd-wan/prisma-sd-wan-admin/prisma-sd-wan-sites-and-d...Better go to the Prisma Access education if you are going to work with it or first ask Palo Alto for a test drive and demo on Prisma Access as they will make one for you:https://www.paloaltonetworks.com/services/education/instructor-led-training#Find_A_Classhttps://www.paloaltonetworks.com/demos",1,05-02-2022,02:25 AM

Also the globalprotect agent can add tolken header when sending the web traffic to Prisma Access and in this way cookies will not be needed as many 3-rth party cloud proxy vendors use endpoint agents with some kind of tolkens for this as cookies cause issues with some sites, other proxy devices in between or browser settings and extensions that block the cookies. Also if the user is in the office then the on-prem firewall will be used but when the user is not an connects to Prisma Access for VPN then globalprotect may autodetect this and stop the Prisma Access Explicit Proxy PAC file settings and in this way with an agent there will be no need to make a gre/ipsec tunnel from the firewall to Prisma Access if the Firewall can't handle the SSL decryption as the Agent will direct the web traffic to Prisma access, using the PAC file even if the VPN is enabled as some companies use VPN even in the office for Security.I hope Palo Alto will start using the Globalprotect agent for Prisma Access Explicit Proxy mode and enable Prisma Access VPN and Prisma Access Proxy (for when the user VPN is connected to the on-prem firewalls or if the user is in the office and globalprotect has detected this using host detection DNS) to work together in the future.",0,04-27-2022,04:28 AM

If all you want to do is identify which routes are RN's you can tag them by advertising them from the branch with a global or regional community string tag and we will advertise / preserve them to the SC with those Community value tags. If you want to identify which regions are which routes, you can advertise specific community tags for specific ""regions"" or ""Geos"".I hope this helps.Thanks,Wade",0,06-16-2020,03:10 PM

126,395527,aper,"I've added comments in greenThe question around design is in a Prisma Access world, where are on-prem perimeter/edge firewalls truly needed. More specifically, where is a FW needed with threat/url/wildfire licenses. Some sites won't have a device capable of IPSec tunnel, so in those cases, sure fw will need to remain but licensing can be removed.With Prisma Access fully deployed, the only location(s) that would still need their own Firewall are the datacenters where the service connection is terminated. Since a SC is the only connection that doesn't have a 'firewall in the cloud' and also can't be used for internet access, whatever internet access that is needed at that site would use it's own internet breakout (or have a secondary Remote Network purely for internet access), From a zero trust perspective it's also good to have a firewall in place to control all incoming connections from remote users and networks (via the SC)My understanding is, a branch site will not need a firewall unless it has local resources that other sites will need to access. I believe this is the case since for service connections, as traffic exits Prisma, it is not inspected, so you'll need an on-prem firewall to do that inspectionsite-to-site from any Remote Network to another RN or a SC traverses an enforcement node, so security policy can be applied to this natively. the only connections that don't pass any enforcement would be Service connection to service connectionWhat about sites that have resources that are accessible to the internet? My thought would be absolutely, but I've heard there is a way to have those internet accessible resources to be routed through Prisma Access? This doesn't make sense to me, I don't see how this is possible. Also, even if it was possible, it would run into the same as above. The traffic leaving Prisma Access to the service connection is not inspected. So for this reason, I believe if you have resources exposed to the internet, local firewall must remain.AFAIK you can't host any services that are accessed from the internet through prisma access, you'd use prisma cloud for cloud-hosted apps and a local firewall for locally hosted appsMy final question is about those offices accessing to the internet. Is there a user limit where you'd want internet traffic to egress a local firewall to the internet, instead of sending it to Prisma Access? For instance, if I have an office with 300,400 or 500 users, is there acceptable performance to send all their internet traffic to Prisma Access or is the on-prem FW a better solution here?The only limiting factor is bandwidth and you can bundle up to 4x500mbps on a single Remote Network, but that will come at a cost. If the site has it's own firewall and you want to save a little money, you could break out trusted connections (o365 for example) locallyThanks!Prisma Access uses two 'zones' for its enforcement. Trust and Untrust. all connections going out to the internet require security rules from trust to untrust. All internal connection (Remote USers, Remote Networks, Service Connections) in any direction is considered trust to trust, but even within the trust area you can create individual zones to delimit users or remote networks, and you can apply security rules on anything TO and FROM Remote Users and Remote Networks, that includes connections to the Service Connectionthe Service Connection should be considered an extension of the datacenter network, everything else needs to pass through a firewallhope this helps",2,04-01-2021,03:22 PM
127,395527,MikeC,"@reaperThanks for the response. I have some more questions, but I'll go from bottom to top.I did see the bandwidth was increased to 500Mbps, but wasn't aware that you could bundle them. Is that 500Mbps shared with multiple remote sites or each site gets 500Mbps? For example, in 1 state, I have 3 different physical locations, would those 3 locations be setup as remote networks and each of them gets 500Mbps or would those 3 share the 500?What about the scenario where the service connection is a site that also has users that require internet access? For example, I have a site with 1GB internet that would be considered a SC, since that's where internal resources would be. However, that same location also has roughly 200 users that would need access to the internet. In this scenario, would I have my HA pair of FWs be the service connection for Prisma but the users would have to egress locally, since the SC can't be used for internet access? If so, can I use the same 1GB link for both, or would it require a dedicated circuit for the SC?",0,04-01-2021,06:32 PM

133,378191,tabner,The only requirement at the branch is that the CPE can build an IPSec tunnel to Prisma Access. So it doesn't matter which vendor it is.You don't need a PAN NGFW or any other FW at the branches unless you need local (east-West) segmentation/security or to inspect traffic that you aren't sending to Prisma Access(e.g. MPLS traffic that won't traverse Prisma Access). You could use a router to forward all traffic via an IPSec tunnel to Prisma Access.The only recommendation for on-prem FWs is for sites where you have service connections. These are theconnections to data centers for the branches and users to access internal shared resources (e.g. AD). The service connections are not subjected to policy so its recommended that you have a FW terminating the Service Connections,0,01-06-2021,11:30 AM

187,318075,SuperMario,"Hi Chacko,Unfortunately, you will have to open a TAC case to troubleshoot this. As you mentioned, you need to run some CLI commands to verify and troubleshoot the configuration.However, here is my suggestion, from my experience, most of the time the issue is due to a format mismatch on the authentication policy vs the group mapping format.Here is an example:If you are usingsAMAccountName on your Authentication Profile, make sure you add the same format on your Group-Mapping configuration.Also, in a standalone Prisma Access deployment without a Master Device, you can use a group-based policy using long-form DN entries in Panorama. Prisma Access uses the DN entries to evaluate the User-ID-based policies you have configured in Panorama.For example, given a User named Bob Alice who works in IT for Organization Hooli in the United States, a matching security policy may have ou=IT Staff,O=Hooli,C=US if the policy is to be applied to all IT staff, or CN=Bob Alice,ou=IT Staff,O=Hooli,C=US if the policy is only to be applied to Bob Alice.Detailed instructions:https://docs.paloaltonetworks.com/prisma/prisma-access/prisma-access-panorama-admin/configure-user-b...https://docs.paloaltonetworks.com/prisma/prisma-access/prisma-access-panorama-admin/configure-user-b...https://docs.paloaltonetworks.com/pan-os/9-0/pan-os-admin/user-id/map-users-to-groups.htmlhttps://docs.paloaltonetworks.com/pan-os/8-1/pan-os-new-features/user-id-features/support-for-multip...I hope this helps.",0,03-23-2020,07:32 PM
