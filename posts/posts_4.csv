We started getting a lot of bittorrent requests. Of course, requests were denied. However, pool.ntp.org started reporting that we were not responding to ntp requests.We captured the packets that PaloAlto detected as bittorrent. When we examined the packages, we could not see anything other than ntp traffic.As a result, we think that PaloAlto mistakenly detected ntp traffic as bittorrent traffic.If you want to examine it, I'm putting a file here that the packages we capture. Thank you.",0,"

61,440578,VirusTotal,xw123olo,L0 Member,False Positive Submission,"Hello. I have a problem with false-positive in Palo Alto Networks. The program falsely marks the Network Graphics.exe executable file as malicious (Generic.ml), although there are no malicious functions in the code that steal user data or harm them in any way Network Graphics is an installer of game modifications for GTA V. It has over 300,000 downloads. Our discord server has over 67,000 subscribers. Unfortunately, false antivirus alerts scare new users and prevent them from using the app. We have to spend time and resources to explain that the application is safe.I was trying to find a piece of code that antivirus considers to be malicious in order to fix this. I also purchased a Code Signing certificate to increase the credibility of the application. But it did not help. It seems to me that the application was blacklisted for some reason.I have attached the latest version of the app to this email. You can also download it from https://vrp.network/redux.

Ezhelp does exactly what our users expect it to do and nothing more. It is a private helpdesk support program that uses ultravnc. Ezhelp is a portable program, that when ran by the user, puts its files in the user’s temp folder and it removes them when the user closes the program. The included files are SecureVNCPlugin.dsm, VNChooks.dll and winvnc.exe which can be found at the widely popular www.uvnc.com website. The included ultravnc.ini file increases security by preventing the user from accidentally allowing incoming connections into their own PC and only allows an outgoing secure encrypted connection to our helpdesk upon the user’s request. Those evaluating the software can look in the temp file and verify all of this. I am the author of the program and have been using it for two decades. Occasionally, EZhelp is updated to include the latest winvnc.exe from www.utravnc.com for its feature and security updates. A copy of the file can be provided as needed.Thank you",0,"

303,303867,VirusTotal,NCH_Soft,L1 Bithead,"Frequent ""generic.ml"" False-Positives","Hi,  We are a consumer software publisher, and since this year's March we're forced to continuously struggle with the mentioned frequent false-positives from your engine's side on a weekly (if not to say daily) basis. We're releasing new files (installers of our apps, which are many) on a daily basis, and the vicious circle here looks something like the following: － we're detecting a ‘pack’ of the false-positives from your end - tens of our files get falsely flagged by your engine each time － we're uploading all the flagged files to our VirusTotal Monitor Collection － you usually stop flagging the files within a day or two after that, sometimes a bit longer, but in the mean-time - we're detecting another ‘pack’ of your false-positives again, then everything repeats We have really lots of files, and their number is growing, so we're just not able to detect every false-positive immediately. Also, the limited storage space, provided by the VT Monitor Service, doesn't allow us to retain all our files, so we have to cull what to upload there manually and then upload manually - this can't be done immediately too. As soon as we've uploaded all necessary files to the VTmonitor Collection, you're resolving the flags fairly fast, yet anyway - not immediately as well. Everything this in sum means that a lot of our customers have more than enough time to actually see the false flags. Needless to say that it isn't good for our reputation at least. Our question is: how can we stop this from being the case? What we can actually do now is to post-deal with the problem only, but are there any preventive actions we are able to take? Can you do something from your side to finally stop falsely flagging our files? Regards,",0,"

It’s the common problem with false detections of these files with antimalware products. That’s not a good point for all of yours’ and our customers. Therefore, both of our sides are interested in implementing better product's compatibility.So, our developers prepared the instructions for your side. They are the following:1.      ASPack.We propose the source code of the simplest unpacking-application that our developers prepared for you. It's useful for unpacking applications, compressed with our ASPack product for the most complete analysis on your side.2.      ASProtect 1.x and ASProtect 2.x 32.We inform you that we have released a product upgrade ASProtect, simplifying antivirus work with protected ASProtect files. The text below contains information on how to use this new feature of our product in your antivirus technology.To facilitate the search of ""bad"" applications that are protected by ASProtect, we propose to use the client identifier (client ID). If you determine that a client with a certain client ID protects the malware, it is justified to detect malware as all applications protected with the client ID. To use this mechanism, we have implemented support for easily readable label client ID in the applications that are protected by ASProtect.Here is the false detection report: https://www.virustotal.com/#/file/ce5db9007570b7afffd225bc55615a4e02f20209a2395c6d244caa45c83dd023/d... Here is the falsely-detected file: https://dropmefiles.com/Z2NgjNote that if you are interested in the content of this letter please let us know so we will send you the enclosed files and more detailed information about client ID.Best regards,Dmitry StepanovCustomer Support GroupStarForce TechnologiesYou Create - We Protecthttp://www.star-force.comIMPORTANT NOTICE: This e-mail, including attachments, is intended for the person or company named and may contain confidential and/or legally privileged information.

681,148432,VirusTotal,gas22,L1 Bithead,VirusTotal false positive reporting mechanism needs improvement,"Greetings, It is my opinion that Palo Alto Networks needs to improve false positive reporting mechanism for 3rd party software vendors. For instance: we monitor our own software releases for false positive detections via VirusTotal. Majority of security vendors working with VirusTotal have simple mechanisms in place to report false positive detections to them, even if you don’t use their software. I can’t seem to find a way to report false positive detection to Palo Alto Networks other than opening a support case. Of course, you can’t open a support case if you aren’t a licensed customer.Please enhance your false positive reporting mechanism to allow software vendors to report problems in your definitions, or to request whitelisting; preferably via private upload / private communication mechanism. I say it because your disclaimer doesn’t give me warm fuzzies about response or turnaround times about false positive reports we'll post in this forum.“Disclaimer:This forum is not a customer support venue. Palo Alto Networks staff will not engage in active discussions on this forum. Our staff will ingest properly formatted submissions for review and update Palo Alto Networks (Known Signatures) verdicts when appropriate.” Thank you,Olegas",0,"
