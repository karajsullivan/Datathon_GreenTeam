Currently we would like to do the upgrade by creating an Upgrade Package and distributing it via the ESM. Unfortunately our clients need to connect through a proxy to have access to the cloud and Cortex XDR 2.0. This would be no problem for some of the agents, but unfortunately more than 70% aren't connected to any kind of management service to just update the system proxy (for that matter, a system-specific proxy isn't even configured). AFAIK there is no way to configure an application-specific proxy for this kind of agents. Does this mean I have to touch every client, uninstall the version 4.2.6 and manually install a newer version compatible with Cortex XDR 2.0? Is there some other non-documented way of pushing a proxy configuration via the Upgrade Package? What about the Broker VM? Any suggestions are appreciated - thank you!~ Archie",0,"

We are doing this in different pilot groups per branch where we also remove the old antivirus solution. The new profiles where malware is actually blocked, are assigned to a static endpoint group. Since we need to migrate more than 300 clients before deploying it for all users, it takes a long time to add them one by one to this endpoint group.Using a dynamic group is unfortunately no option since the clients are all in the same domain, have the same naming convention as other branches and the IP's can also be similar to other branches when they're on the VPN.  I'm interested how other administrators are dealing with this? Maybe a new feature in TMS to bulk import clients into a static group would also be nice? ",1,"

But after 5 minutes it disappears again from the console. After reviewing the configuration, we have disabled the check of the ESM of automatic license revocation. After we have changed this configuration, the agents have started connecting correctly. Also we have checked that some agents that are connected to the ESM have the last heartbeat from last week, and they are still running.

I tried using smtp-relay.gmail.com and smtp.gmail.com on ports 25, 465, and 587. Palo Alto Support has asked that I provide logs from Google's servers, which is not possible. Google support has assured me that nothing on their end should block smtp relays with my rule enabled.

Python sees, like the Powershell process, also the files «Python command (print(os.listdir('C:\\Users\\xxx\\Desktop\\')))» So I made an exclusion for the powershell. exe process, in which I deactivated the AntiRansomware module. After that the files are no longer visible with the command Get-ChildItem!!! *, but the python. exe process still sees the files. Means that the files are not actually present. These are really files simulated by traps for all processes. After the first default rule, this rule applies to all processes. After that, however, there are some compatibility rules where PaloAlto excludes the anti-ransom virus protection for certain processes. PaloALto has even more possibilities than us via GUI, they also have exclusions about the directories to be monitored. Now we know which files are being monitored, but not which actions. I understood this with powersehll. exe and python and came to this result:The following actions are monitored by traps (shown an alert): However, Traps does not recognize when a process recreates a file with exactly the same file name as one of these simulated files. Powershell. exe which sees these simulated files says about it:    New-Item c:\Users\xxx\Desktop\!!!!!2126159552.doc -ItemType file    New-Item : Die Datei ""C:\Users\xxx\Desktop\!!!!!2126159552.doc"" already existsCmd. exe which does not see the files means:    C:\Users\xxx\Desktop>echo some-text  > !!!!!2126159552.doc    Access denied  Either way, no traps alert is generated. Also there is no alert if the filename is appended with another character instead of !!!!!!! 2523101513. pst,!!!!!! 2523101515139. pst. This means that it only monitors these simulated files. A new Ransomware that writes other file names, even if they start with five exclamation marks or ZZZZ, will not give an alert. Therefore, I interpret the default rule parameter Ransom. HoneypotNamePatterns=ZZZZZ;!!!!! So that this is the fixed part of the filename of these simulated files, the numbers i think are random.  What possibilities do we have for exclusion? Unfortunately, via Gui we have no possibility to make other exclusions than to exclude a corresponding process. I hope, however, that in the future we will be able to include the directories to be monitored in/exists and the files and file patterns to be simulated. I hope this could help a little bit",5,"

If you choose to use a load balancer, be sure to set all ESM Servers to ""Disabled"" in ESM Console's Settings > ESM > Multi-ESM tab. This setting does not disable the ESM Servers as whole; ESM Servers set to ""Disabled"" on this screen continue to operate as normal except that they do not participate in the Multi-ESM algorithm. If you fail to set the ESM Servers to ""Disabled"" in a load-balancer configuration, the consequece will be that endpoints learn about the serves as part of their regular heartbeat cycle and then might (depending on network topology) try to connect directly to an ESM Server instead of through your load balancer. The Multi-ESM Algorithm On each heartbeat, each endpoint: Deployment without Load Balancer Deployment with Load Balancer  Willian    ",3,"
