288,378116,tsullivan7,Hi@tsullivan7Thank you for your help.Please note that our update (v 1.1) has been flagged as well.Here are some useful links:VirusTotal page:https://www.virustotal.com/gui/file/21bfe53702e1752e46d70f79ae303ffcef53922ffca4cd882b635b9357ea6c05...App landing page:https://hydraproxy.com/hydraheaders/Version 1.1 update download link:https://app.box.com/s/oj2hrtm2fygotzd0ffvpidsz0r7q92odCould you please consider this for removing the false-positive?Thank you!,0,01-06-2021,07:59 AM
289,378116,hydraproxy,"If your software continues getting flagged by Wildfire as malicious, it would be advisable to consider what's in the code. Is the code digitally signed? If not you may want to consider this to limit the false positives.One thing Wildfire detected is the sample contacting an IP address info service via HTTP.This is often used by malware to tailor a message or note to the compromised system in a user's language by geographic IP location. This behavior is also used often used by malware to identify sandboxes to prevent executing in a lab environment.I've submitted it for a verdict change evaluation.",0,01-28-2021,01:06 AM
290,378116,tsullivan7,"Hi,Thank you for the quick reply.Regarding the contacting IP, indeed, the app makes a request at every launch to our server to check for updates. The page it contacts is a simple HTML file with the latest version and the app simply reads the last version number posted on the page and if different from the current version of the app, it informs the user and asks him if he wants to update or not.Regarding the code signing, even from the first version, we sign the code. We never ship it unsigned.",1,01-28-2021,06:32 AM

404,328169,mivaldi,We had issues with GP and Jabber about a month ago. It seemed to explicitly affect people using Verizon iOS devices as hotspots. I was able to fix it by disabling the SIP ALG. It’s really simple—literally just a single checkbox. Worth a try.https://knowledgebase.paloaltonetworks.com/KCSArticleDetail?id=kA10g000000ClEsCAK,0,05-15-2020,09:59 AM

I'm currently experiencing the same thing with some calls working fine over GP and then others just ring, but you can leave a voicemail, then other just don't work at all, then all the sudden they can talk.

I don't think this is a virus and is more than likely a false+. I was looking into this a little further and found out that the file is being hosted herehttps://chocolatey.org/packages/microsoft-teams#files. The file passes all checks on their site which you can view the Registry Snapshot by going to the following linkhttps://gist.github.com/choco-bot/94b957a0ae5da9a075eb88dd4c890bd9. If I get some time I will download the file on my VM and run it through some checks and will update. I agree with the above comment and open a case so that Palo can take a look into this further.

1091,216678,mivaldi,"https://www.paloaltonetworks.com/documentation/translated/70/newfeaturesguide/wildfire-features/wild...The WildFire grayware verdict classifies files that behave similarly to malware, but are not malicious in nature or intent. A grayware verdict might be assigned to files that do not pose a direct security threat, but display otherwise obtrusive behavior (for example, installing unwanted software, changing various system settings, or reducing system performance). Examples of grayware software can typically include adware, spyware, and Browser Helper Objects (BHOs). The grayware verdict allows you to quickly distinguish malicious files on the network from grayware, and to prioritize accordingly.Antivirus signatures are not generated for grayware and security policies cannot be enforced based on the grayware verdict. However, logs and reports can continue to alert to endpoints downloading grayware, enabling you to take any necessary action.",0,06-08-2018,08:58 AM

A grayware verdict might be assigned to files that do not pose a direct security threat, but display otherwise obtrusive behavior (for example, installing unwanted software, changing various system settings, or reducing system performance). Examples of grayware software can typically include adware, spyware, and Browser Helper Objects (BHOs). The grayware verdict allows you to quickly distinguish malicious files on the network from grayware, and to prioritize accordingly.Antivirus signatures are not generated for grayware and security policies cannot be enforced based on the grayware verdict.

A grayware verdict might be assigned to files that do not pose a direct security threat, but display otherwise obtrusive behavior (for example, installing unwanted software, changing various system settings, or reducing system performance). Examples of grayware software can typically include adware, spyware, and Browser Helper Objects (BHOs). The grayware verdict allows you to quickly distinguish malicious files on the network from grayware, and to prioritize accordingly.Antivirus signatures are not generated for grayware and security policies cannot be enforced based on the grayware verdict.

The reason why we can't disable the signature, is because that would mean that we would allow both the Benign installer, and the trojanized version, resolving the problem for you, but exposing everyone else to get infected.One of the possible counter-measures to this, is to increase the specifity of the Malware signature, to make sure it matches the Malware variant, and not the Benign file.The increased specifity of the signature not always resolves the collisions, but I will give it a try, and come back to you with our results.",0,11-15-2017,11:15 AM
1370,186266,mivaldi,"We've made the signature more specific, to prevent probability of collisions.If the change yields the expected results, youshould see the collision resolved after installing tomorrows release of the Antivirus package.",0,11-15-2017,01:54 PM
1371,186266,puppetjt,"MivaldiThank you so much for looking in to this. I'll have to wait until the realse is ready, as I think im 4 hour off at this stage.Out of interest, what was incorrect with the link I gave? It was indeed the installer itself that was flagging the Palo Alto (literally just clicking that link in the browser would throw the error). Reason I'm interested is that I'd like to understand how better to submit these issues in the future.ThanksJT",0,11-16-2017,03:03 AM
1372,186266,mivaldi,"When you submit an URL to Virus Total instead of a File, it scans the website for any persistent malicious code that would attempt to hijack your browser. The follow up download happens at a separate report. (I just realized there's a left-over link that points you to the analysis of the downloaded file).So it was not incorrect, but the VT report you submitted was for the URL,not the file -not a big deal-If you are a Palo Alto Networks customer, you shouldopen a case with Palo Alto Networks Support, instead of using this forum.",0,11-16-2017,09:33 AM

If it is not a FP, please let us know what's the issue that app should fix to improve based on your detection criteria. If it is a FP, please help to solve the detection and update the signature in VT.Thanks!HongResearcher @ AppEsteem",0,03-27-2017,12:50 PM

1472,148432,JeffMathis,"""Compatibility TestApplication Program:Application compatibility is important when trying to access a network. Without certified compatibility, users risk denied accessand administrators must write policy exceptions.The program enables CASB, NAC, SSL-VPN,and SSOcompatibility on thousands of leading access controls from vendors like Palo Alto Networks and others. Compatibilityensuresthat the application can be detected,classified, and displayed from over200,000,000endpointsin a networkadministrator's management console.

Since you don't have one, then just revert to the process of False Positives directly to VirusTotal.com . They have just began this Threat Intel Sharing in the last week or two.The interesting part that I thought was SOP at Virus Total is ""THEY DO NOT"" WHITELIST anything, unless the Virus Engine is reported to by the Virus Total client to work directly with AV vendor to determine if in fact it is a false positve and report the Positive Confirmation of the False Positive as referenced in Virus Total Anti Virus signature.Speaking of Virus Total though leads to a pretty decent Personal/Free End-Point solution.

1473,148432,gas22,"VirusTotal.com is not responsible for the outcome of analysis, nor should they whitelist anything. VirusTotal.com simply aggregates scan results from different vendor definitions.Definition providers (such as Palo Alto Networks, etc) are ultimately responsible for detection signatures and whitelisting.We’ve worked with many antivirus vendors interfacing with VirusTotal.com in the past, and most of them have very simple mechanism to report false positive detections to them (upload via website, encrypted email, etc). Palo Alto Networks does not appear to have such mechanism, beyond posting in this forum. The forum’s disclaimer doesn’t seem to reassure that my false positive reports will be taken seriously and addressed in reasonably fast manner.",0,03-20-2017,03:23 PM
