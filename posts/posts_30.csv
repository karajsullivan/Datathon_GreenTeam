Palo Alto Networks Cortex XDR - Investigation and Response content pack is already installed and I set the propagation label to xdr_test and xdr_master. In theory this pack shouldn't be syncable with the tenant I just created. Here is what happens, every single component of the content pack is now syncable.   Another thing to note is that if I set the propagation label to all in this case only the content pack is syncable, not every component.I upgraded from 6.6 to 6.8 just to check if the latest release fixed the issue but unfortunately it didn't. did I misunderstand how propagation labels work?

In addition I have ensured that the outgoing email contains the EmailGeneratedCode with is 8 characters long and nevertheless this does not work and the reply email is created as a new incident. For the sake of piece of mind I have extracted the EmailGeneratedCode to another key and included it in the subject as well but to no effect. While performing the test i can see that upon each test the code is refreshed on the incident side and this is expected.  Has anyone encountered this problem before ?To summarise my understanding of the use case. 1) Outgoing email from demisto to user. Containing this Email Generated code in ${} 2) User replies with the same subject as defualt. 3) The email arrives to Demisto and the Pre-Process Script assigns and extracts the details to the existing ""original"" incident based on this static code. 4) The Email Thread is updated through tags and the new and future replies are not created as a new incident. If this is not the chain of expected events please correct me. ",0,"

I want to import a csv file in the context, having column names as the subkeys. And then I want to get rid off some excessive subkeys/columns.My steps are:1. upload a file from file share using smb-download - SUCCESS2. Import file in the context keys using ParseCSV automation - SUCCESS3. Set a new key to only store selected subkeys - FAILfor the last, i'm using:!SetMultipleValues parent=testKey keys=""Name,Surname"" values=""${ParseCSV.ParsedCSV.Name},${ParseCSV.ParsedCSV.Surname}"" it seems that SetMultipleValues does not recognize that there is more than one value on the same subkey (i.e. ParseCSV.ParsedCSV.[0].Name, ParseCSV.ParsedCSV.[1].Name, ParseCSV.ParsedCSV.[2].Name etc) and is not running on all subkeys. What am i missing? Is there another easy way to take selected subkeys and store it on the separate subkeys? Using XSOAR 6.6 for this. Thank you,Antanas ",0,"

I have one question. lets say we are fetching the incidents for any specific time interval and now considering SOAR recommended fetch limit of 200 Incidents per fetch, there can be situation when we might have more than 200 incidents and in this case we will have backlog of these remaining incidents for next fetches. Such situation can occur multiple times and backlog incidents will go onto multiply. Now can we invoke this integration instance dynamically so that we can bring rest of incidents(incidents after 200th incident in that time interval) quickly without waiting for next fetch?",0,"

Our customer created a XSOAR list, that contains a html string with context data variables in it, like ${testinput}.In a playbook with test incidents he has set the key (e.g. ${testinput} = ""test""). Now he tries to call the list as a variable in a task (${list.mylist}) and send the html body from the list as a mail, in which the variables (like ${testinput}) would be interpreted and sent out as the value of the key. So the receiver would get a mail with ""test"" in the mailbody, not ""${testinput}"". In this scenario, the mail will always be filled with ""${testinput}"". My question in general is: Is it possible at all to make XSOAR interpret nested variables as the context value, like in this example? Or will XSOAR always interpret the top level variable as a pure string, so that the lower level variables won't be interpreted.Thanks for your time and work.

Is it univocally identified in the computer that is installed regardless of its name or IP address? If the computer with a complete image is replatformed, does it still count the old agent, which will no longer respond, in addition to the new one?

Now when it comes to assigning the Read-only role this has become a challenge. Unlike the other previously configured roles that also included not only the SAML mapping but also the Shift assignments, which work. The Read-Only role does not, this issue is specific to the role and is an issue within XSOAR.  I have even upgraded to the latest App version to attempt to resolve this as suggessted within a techdoc.  SAML is not an issue here since there are 4 other roles that function as expected and user are allowed to log onto XSOAR.

The idea is now to do the mapping and I am stuck. The JSON contains the classic key value pairs but some of the values are actually arrays with dictionaries in them. For example hostStates:[{""fqdn"":""host.domain.example"",""isAzureAdJoined"":""false"",...}] I would like to map the Hostnames field to the fqdn but I have no clue how to. I tried a couple of things already (hostStates.fqdn and hostStates[0]['fqdn']) without success.I noticed that in the examples I found online everybody has a nice key:value, nothing like what I am trying to do so this makes me wonder if what I am trying to do is actually possible via the web interface. Like I said, this is a new tool for me and so every day I am learning something new. Kind regards,Erik",0,"
