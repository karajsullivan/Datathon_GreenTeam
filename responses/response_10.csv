After creating, maybe 10 or 15 minutes passed and the Instance Status shows red exclamation point icon. When hovering over the icon it pops up message ""Status: Error"", but gives no other information. What does this mean?NGFW certificates are correctly installed. CDL for telemetry data is created and showing firewalls as connected.",0,05-19-2022,08:03 AM
