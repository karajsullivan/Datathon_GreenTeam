0,505819,Cloud Identity Engine Discussions,OwenFuller,L4 Transporter,Cloud Identity Engine for On-Premises Global Protect,"Has anyone used the Cloud Identity Engine for authentication for an on-prem Global Protect portal/gateway?I'm experimenting with the CIE. It works great for admin login to the GUI, but I'm trying to set it up as an auth source for GP. It is working just fine on the portal for web browser auth (i.e. to download the agent), but I'm getting authentication failures when I try to login w/ the agent itself. The browser will open, and redirect to Okta. However, after redirecting back to the firewall, I get a message saying ""Authentication failed. Please click the button below to relaunch authentication."" The retry button takes me back through a similar flow, and then I ultimately get a message that says ""Authentication Failed. Please contact the administrator for further assistance. Error code: 0.""",0,"

I configured a firewall to use CIE, but it doesn't appear to be working. I can see the groups and select them in policies, but no users from those groups are seen on the firewall. ""show user cloud-identity-engine client stat"" shows groups, but they show as unmapped (not sure if it should show mapped). ""show user cloud-identity-engine status all"" shows the name of the directory APP, but all stats are 0 or say never. Same with ""show user cloud-identity-engine statistics all"". Any help would be appreciated.",0,"

4,459819,Cloud Identity Engine Discussions,TVanBeek,L0 Member,Administrator CLI access via Cloud Identity Engine,"Hi Experts “Administrators can use SAML to authenticate to the firewall or Panorama web interface but not to the CLI”, as mentioned in the PAN-OS administrator documentation. Can we use the Cloud Identity Engine instead to authenticate administrators to the CLI? So that we connect via SAML to the CIE, and we use CIE in an authentication profile to login the NGFW GUI, CLI and API ? Thanks for your reply.CheersTomas",0,"

""cloud-identity-engine-instance is invalid""  Everything looks correct that I have setup.   It works if I do the Auth profile it connects to the CIE.   But the real problem is when I go to Policies and try to create a Auth policy or Security Policy, when I click on Source user it comes up blank.   I cannot select a user or group to add to my policies.",0,"

7,411318,Cloud Identity Engine Discussions,blevin,L1 Bithead,Why should customers use Cloud Identity Engine and User-ID on the firewall for identity-based security?,"Cloud IAM vendors are meant for Identities (managing users and groups), but they do not enforce security policies on these identities as they are not a firewall. With PANW, our customers can authenticate using groups/users in these Cloud IdPs and enforce identity-based security policies (URL Filtering, Cred Phishing, etc.) Customers can achieve the same outcomes if they use Okta with PANW firewalls or Okta with Fortinet firewalls; however, a cloud-offered service like Cloud Identity Engine keeps users and group information in sync with the cloud IdP and onprem Idps providers to PANW firewall products. This way, the user information is dynamically updated at all times.",0,"

8,411317,Cloud Identity Engine Discussions,blevin,L1 Bithead,"How is the cloud Identity Engine different from other IAM vendors (e.g., Okta or Ping or Azure AD)?","Cloud Identity Engine is a broker service and not IAM. It collects user and group information from multiple IAM vendors—like Okta Ping, and similar platforms—making the info uniformly available across all firewalls. Customers will continue to leverage their IAM providers; however, they no longer need to connect every IAM with every firewall. Cloud IAM tools (like OKTA, Ping, Azure AD, etc.) are meant for identities—i.e. for maintaining users and user group information. But they are not firewall companies, and so cannot and do not enforce security policies. With Palo Alto Networks, customers can authenticate users using groups/users in these Cloud IdPs and enforce identity-based security policies—such as Credential Phishing—along with our URL Filtering subscription.  A cloud-offered service like Cloud Identity Engine keeps users and group information in sync with the Cloud IdP and On-prem Idps to PANW firewall at all times. By dynamically updating user information, complexity and operational burden are greatly reduced. ",0,"
