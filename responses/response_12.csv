0,484315,Adrian_Jensen,"After considerable digging I have found this was being caused by 2 separate issues.1) A Windows11 upgrade, with existing user accounts on the box, breaks permissions for the GP client to access existing certificates. Newly created user accounts and user certificates created after the upgrade do not have a problem. This seems to result from Windows11 breaking permission to access the private key portion of the existing user certificate. The GP client correctly receives the request from the portal to provide a user certificate for authorization, it correctly identifies the personal certificate(s) signed by the CA, but the GP client then fails when it tries to read the certificate private key to sign the authentication reply to the portal:(P17016-T20652)Error(2290): 04/29/22 18:12:04:432 error = ERROR_WINHTTP_CLIENT_CERT_NO_ACCESS_PRIVATE_KEY(P17016-T20652)Debug(2377): 04/29/22 18:12:04:432 winhttpObj, got ERROR_WINHTTP_CLIENT_CERT_NO_ACCESS_PRIVATE_KEY, clean cert cache now(P17016-T20652)Debug(4578): 04/29/22 18:12:04:432 winhttpobj, cert do not has private key???? clean lastIssuerName now, data = 0000000000000000This results in a ""Network connection is unreachable or the portal is unresponsive."" error in the GP client. In a browser connection to the portal the error message ""Valid client certificate is required"". And in the PA logs the error as ""Client cert not present"".The GP client can definitely access the rest of the cert as it shows its details just before trying to access the private key. The fix is to export and save the personal certificate (with private key), delete the certificate from the user's personal cert store, and then re-import the same certificate back into the cert store. The GP client can then read the private key for signing. Alternatively, the old certificate can be deleted and a new key generated.2) Personal certificates with special characters in the common name are not recognized as valid by the PA portal for authentication. If a user has a certificate with a Subject like:CN=Firstname ""Nickname"" Lastname,OU=Personal,OU=Corporate,DC=example,DC=comThe GP client correctly identifies the personal certificate as signed by the CA and reads the Subject, including the "" quote marks. The GP client then sends the user public cert to the PA portal which responds with an error:(P2756-T16964)Debug(2699): 05/06/22 10:48:38:506 box return Valid client certificate is required, remove cache and close all handle now(P2756-T16964)Debug(5134): 05/06/22 10:48:38:506 we get cert error, so remove previousCertificate(P2756-T16964)Debug(4757): 05/06/22 10:48:38:506 client certificate error found: Client cert usage check failedThe GP client then shows an error that a valid client certificate is required to connect to the portal. The PA logs the error as ""Client cert not present"". This looks to be a data handling error on the PA side. As far as I can tell, X509/RFC5280 allows any printable character in the DN name (up to 64), including all UTF8 and UTF16 characters. Certain manufacturers prohibit some special characters in the string (such as "" , - ? ), but that doesn't seem to be universal.Edit: This PaloAlto KB states that some special characters are not allowed in the common name (though some how in a week of searching for""Valid client certificate is required"" errors I never found it).https://knowledgebase.paloaltonetworks.com/kCSArticleDetail?id=kA10g000000PLhx",2,05-06-2022,03:34 PM

15,437370,WeidmannIT,HelloYou can use Internal Gateway as possible solution.,1,10-26-2021,05:20 AM
16,437370,TomYoung,"Hi @tamilvanan ,Yes, this can be done. In addition to your external gateway, you would configure an internal gateway in non-tunnel mode with Internal Host Detection enabled. https://knowledgebase.paloaltonetworks.com/kCSArticleDetail?id=kA10g000000ClH1Note in the doc that (1) the trust interface is used, (2) the Agent tab on the gateway is not configured (Tunnel Mode is not checked). As the name implies, no encrypted tunnel is formed between the client and the gateway.This configuration has the added benefit of providing accurate User-ID inside the network and enforcing HIP checks if configured.Here is more info on Internal Host Detection -> https://docs.paloaltonetworks.com/pan-os/10-1/pan-os-web-interface-help/globalprotect/network-global....Here is more info on types of gateways -> https://docs.paloaltonetworks.com/globalprotect/10-1/globalprotect-admin/globalprotect-gateways/glob....Thanks,Tom",3,10-26-2021,08:23 PM

34,507314,serge.kovalev,"I would not ask this question if there is no issue and everything works by default. We have multiple sites deployed and neither allowed BYOD to BYOD communication by default since installed to itself. It was not a problem until we were asked to allow such communication. One of the offices does not have site-to-site VPN with the main office. All computers are joined via GlobalProtect from remote office to the HQ Palo. Now we have to allow one remote office computer (name it 'Client') connect to another remote office computer (name it 'Server') in the same location. The overall route looks like RemoteOffice -> GlobalProtect -> HQ Palo -> GlobalProtect -> RemoteOffice. Please, keep in mind this is same remote office. Intrazone to intrazone is allowed, traffic leaves 'Client', goes to the VPN and disappears somewhere on the firewall. No rules are hit. I assume it is a routing issue, not firewall.Palo issues P2P addresses to GlobalProtect clients aka 172.16.1.1/32 and 172.16.1.2/32. Receiving the traffic from GlobalProtect client it can successfully route it to any external location in accordance with its routing table but never diverts it back to the same tunnel of what I found.If you have any experience with the above situation, please, share your routing table.",0,06-30-2022,06:47 PM
35,507314,TomYoung,"Hi @serge.kovalev ,Yes, it is possible. Are you using full-tunnel or split-tunnel? If split-tunnel, ensure 172.16.1.0/24 is part of the split-tunnel access route.Thanks,Tom",2,06-30-2022,07:08 PM
36,507314,Astardzhiev,"Hey @serge.kovalev ,By default GlobalProtect will add host route /32 for the IP assigned from the GP IP pool and one for the DNS server (if GP is configured to assign any). As @TomYoung suggest it seems you are using split-tunnel so the GP connect machines doesn't actually have routes for the GP network and don't know how to reach the other GP clients. This would different story if you are using full-tunnel, in this case GP will install default route poiniting to the tunnel so will not matter that there is no specific route for GP pool.You should be able to confirm this by:- Connect the 'client' machine to GP VPN- Check host routing table (assuming it is Windows) by running ""route print"" in cmd/powershell prompt.- On the firewall you should see specific routes for each IP assigned from the pool pointing to the tunnel associated with the GP gateway.",2,07-01-2022,12:07 AM

38,507314,Astardzhiev,"Hi @serge.kovalev ,Glad to hear it is working.I am assuming manually adding the route with ""route add"" is not enough, because you only point the traffic to the tunnel, but it still needs to be part of the encryption domain. I would assume when configuring the split tunnel GP is automatically adding the route to the IPsec negotiation, while adding it manually on the host doesn't.",0,07-05-2022,06:12 AM

The problem is that you can'tinitiatea connection from the wireless network?If that's the case, have you verified that the wireless network can actually connect to the GlobalProtect portal address? It could be that the network associated with your WiFi network can access the GlobalProtect Gateway, but it's unable to access to actual Portal.The logs to look at here would be reviewing the traffic logs on the associated GlobalProtect Portal to ensure that you aren't denying/droping any traffic from the WiFi associated network, and then looking at the PanGPS.log file on the client side of things to see what the client itself is reporting.",0,06-30-2022,01:57 PM

61,506077,Adrian_Jensen,"Depending on how you issue your certificates for GlobalProtect (there are 3 sources, but only 2 are discussed here), if the old certificate is expiring you will need generate a signing request and have an external authority (i.e. Network Solutions) or your internal CA sign it. The document you listed is the general procedure, but 7.1 is a very old version of PANOS. Is that what you are actually running on your device? You can check the running version from the Dashboard tab (""Software Version"" line) or from Device tab -> Software. On the listed page you can go to instructions for other versions by selecting/changing the drop-down box ""CURRENT VERSION: 7.1 (EoL)"".General steps are:1) Generate a new certificate. Give it a unique Certificate Name, I would suggest something like ""GlobalProtect_2022"" to differentiate it from the previous/future versions of the same use. Set the Common Name to be your GP FQDN. Set ""Signed by:"" to be ""External Authority"". Important part - under Certificate Attribute be sure to set a ""Host Name"" value to be the same as your GP FQDN and any other FQDNs you will be connecting as (this will appear in a Subject Alternative Name tag in the final certificate, which is what browsers/etc. use now instead of Common Name). Your certificate provider may restrict what names you can use. Also fill out the Country, State, Locality, and Organization values as your cert provider will probably require those as well. Generate the certificate and then select/export it. You will get a CSR (Certificate Signing Request), to send to your CA.2) After you CA has generated your certificate, import the file from the same page. Important - from the import page use the exact same ""Certificate Name"" you created above. This will match the certificate to the CSR you generated before and convert the CSR into a private/public certificate pair that can be used on the VPN Portal/Gateway.3) When you are ready to switch to the new certificate, go to your Portal and Gateway configurations and determine which SSL/TLS Service Profile they are currently using:  Network -> GlobalProtect -> Portals -> [config] -> Authentication -> SSL/TLS Service Profile  Network -> GlobalProtect -> Gateways -> [config] -> Authentication -> SSL/TLS Service ProfileDepending on how you have the Portal/Gateway setup, these may be the same or separate profiles. Update the profile to use the new certificate. After commiting it may take a few minutes for the VPN/web services to restart using the new certificate.

67,506077,Danross,It's telling you that that keys do not match. What cert types do you have the option of downloading from your CA?

Your CA could potentially help with that as well.,0,06-29-2022,07:39 AM
68,506077,Adrian_Jensen,"As@Danross says, the private key you generated in step #1 does not match the public key you received back from the CA in step #2.

Both would be relatively simple:Client EndpointThere's multiple ways to do this, anything from parsing ipconfig information to seeing if you can access an internal resource and using the response to return status. The surefire way would be to parse Get-NetAdapter response and find the status of PANGP Virtual Ethernet Adapter.

77,506095,BPry,"@nikkikole,Using the quarantine feature for this actuallyisn'twhat I would personally recommend. Rather than quarantine the device, why not create security rulebase entries around a corresponding HIP-Profile? Use the HIP Notification to alert the end-user that they have been restricted from accessing internal resources and why, and then use the HIP-Profile in the security rulebase to restrict matching endpoints from accessing internal resources and only allow them access to the internet. That way, as soon as the issue is corrected they can just re-submit their HIP data and the firewall will automatically start allowing traffic again once they no longer match the HIP Profile.If you use the Device Quarantine feature, the firewall won't automatically remove these entries once the issue has been fixed. You'd have to build out a remediation detection method and script the automated removal yourself. Quarantine is really meant for a compromised endpoint, I'd use HIP Profiles for ""minor"" correctable infractions like failing an AV check.",0,06-24-2022,08:05 PM

126,386797,mountainfun,"Still seeing this after activating 5.2.6 from PAN-OS 8.1.6 and running GlobalProtect Version 5.2.6-87.To change this on the Portal, go to Network tab>GlobalProtect>Portals>choose the Portal>from GlobalProtect Portal Configuration screen, click on Agent>select relevant option under Configs>click on App tab>the option is called ""Display IPSec to SSL Fallback Notification"" by default this is set to Yes, change to No>click on OK>click on OK again>repeat for any other Portals where this change is required>Commit changes to Panorama or to the Firewall as required to suppress message as needed.As mentioned from userEmr_1to suppress this message, this needs to be disabled from the Gateway, from Network tab>GlobalProtect>Gateways>Agent>under Tunnel Settings tab, uncheck the Enable IPSec>repeat for any other Gateways where this change is required>Commit changes to Panorama or to the Firewall as required to suppress message as needed.Another point to consider, which I ran into, is whether or not you are having issues with GlobalProtect traffic dropping IPSec connections, using UDP Port 4501.When GlobalProtect client will try to connect, first, it will try to connect over IPSec, using UDP, the faster protocol, if this fails, then GlobalProtect will fallback to SSL, over TCP, the slower protocol. The message that is shown, is because GlobalProtect client is failing back from IPSec to SSL for the VPN connection.Performed a collect of GPClient logs from Windows laptop and searched in PANGPS.log for ""Trying to do IPsec""found that this was generating failed to receive keep alive, then followed byDisconnect udp socket, then few lines down we see ipsec failed to start then we see IPSec fallback reason is IPSec connection failed.Upon further investigation on the Traffic Monitor,we saw that traffic to UDP port 4501 is being denied for the GlobalProtect security policy, as a result, the IPSec Tunnel will fail and fallback to SSL will occur.Proceeded to modify the GlobalProtect Security Policy that we had in place, added in the IPSec application, then changed theGlobalProtect>Gateways>Agent>under Tunnel Settings tab, re-checked the Enable IPSec>Committed changes.This time, when my client connected to the GlobalProtect VPN, I saw IPSec as the Connection type, no longer seeing Notification Warning message. Repeated the same process for my other Gateways, left Portal to have Notification for Fallback set to No and this worked.Need to keep in mind why the message is appearing, as sometimes this can be an indication of an underlying configuration issue that you should focus on, so as to provide an optimal user experience.

If the Portal is inaccessible, as it shows above, then the cached Portal config is used.If you set ""Save Username Only"" to ""No"", GlobalProtect will no longer be able to find a cached config, since the name of it includes a hash of the username and relies on saved username to pick it up. That's why you've started to see the issue after disabling it.I would recommend saving the username to ensure a cached config can be used in case of connectivity issues to the Portal.

171,391893,svintinner,"For the guys that have replied, I'm curious what kind of performance you see on your GlobalProtect sessions? I think it might be helpful to set a baseline when talking about GlobalProtect performance. I've read tons of these posts on the forums, but rarely see anyone discuss what we should expect.In my testing I can never average more than 50-70 mbps GlobalProtect SSL VPN connection (dedicated 3020 firewall with just me, dedicated 1 Gbps internet link on both sides for just me, 30ms latency, no inspection or app-id, no QoS, iperf3). I can open a second SSL VPN connection from a different computer and simultaneously get another 50-70 mbps without impacting the first session. I don't see a significant CPU load on the firewall at either point. I can do testing outside GlobalProtect (static NAT) and pretty consistently get 940 mbps. My assumption is that this is some internal tuning limitations that we can't see.On my production system, I will have stretches where I can get 50-70 mbps, but this will frequently drop down to the 2-10 mbps range (for minutes at a time). Like the OP, the overall bandwidth usage doesn't explain all of the issues).  Certainly, I can see slowness when there are peaks in bandwidth usage, but I also see slowness that doesn't correspond to any bandwidth usage. My assumption is that it is due to firewall load (although the firewall doesn't show 100% CPU, I assume the GP process is somehow throttled and that the performance slowness is due to other stream processing inspections and app-id that is happening).I can run a simultaneous test (iperf3) where I test using a static NAT (non-GP) at 200 mbps, along side 2 GP connections. The static NAT connection will remain consistent, while the two GP connections will suffer performance hits around the same time.I should note that I've read the usual comments about SSL VPN and performance (due to a TCP session encapsulated in another TCP session). I can see this demonstrated when I do testing at my DR site and I run into (what I assume) are throttling issues when the interior and exterior TCP sessions have conflicting sliding windows. For example, the session will be cooking along at 70mbps for 30 seconds, then drop to zero and then ramp back up to 70 mbps. I'm planning to do some testing on my test site with GlobalProtect in IPSEC mode to see if this goes away or if my overall bandwidth is improved.Anyway here are some things I've noticed (recognizing this is the blind leading the blind), in case any of it give you some things to check on your system:If anyone has any better information, especially about the internal workings or scheduling of GP traffic inside the firewall, I'd love to hear it.",2,03-22-2021,09:31 AM

To do that securely, you would need to create a new entry for every single device. You could create a generic Host Name contains 'naming convention' to have a more broad HIP object capture these hosts and use that to build out your HIP-Profile, but I wouldn't really say that's a safe solution.Effectively:The HIP-Profile would end up looking something like this depending on what you actually named things to identify hosts that match Hostname-Check but don't actually pass the Domain-Check validation:",0,05-20-2022,08:18 PM

224,487137,Adrian_Jensen,"Theoretically yes, I think (but not sure) that having no connections left would count as a gateway error, the same as being unreachable. The GP client would try to connect to the Highest priority gateway, find that it can't connect, and then go to the High priority gateway to try and connect.However... For the initial gateway selection with a small number of gateways with roughly equal latency, there are effectively only 2 selections that guaranty one gateway gets chosen over the other in non-error conditions: Highest/High/Medium or Low/Lowest. This is because of the way the selection algorithm works. The Highest/High/Medium gateways are all lumped together and a latency check to each is performed (assuming in the correct region). The average latency to all is calculated and those gateways over the average are temporarily excluded. The Highest/High/Medium priorities are then applied to the remaining gateways and connections attempted to each in order of priority. If none of the chosen initial gateways are reachable, then the excluded gateways and Low/Lowest are attempted in order of priority.For example, if you have 2 gateways, one set to Highest and the second set to Medium, with roughly equal latency, then the first connection attempt is always whichever gateway has a lower latency at the moment (because the slightly higher latency gateway is greater than the average latency). In order to force the priority one has to be in the Highest/High/Medium group, and the second in the Low/Lowest group.This can lead to some non-ideal or unexpected gateway connection ordering when dealing with gateways that have similar latency (where the difference between is mostly determined by measurement jitter).Ideal gateway selection:  Highest-Medium average latency = 62ms, Gateway connection order (gw1 -> gw2) -> (gw3 -> gw4 -> gw5)Ideal 2 gateway selection:  Highest-Medium average latency = 55ms, Gateway connection order (gw1) -> (gw2)Unexpected 2 gateway selection due to latency:  Highest-Medium average latency = 55ms, Gateway connection order (gw2) -> (gw1)Forcing 2 gateway selection regardless of latency:  Highest-Medium average latency = 60ms, Gateway connection order (gw1) -> (gw2)Unexpected 5 gateway selection with normally high priority gateways experiencing high latency:  Highest-Medium average latency = 87ms, Gateway connection order (gw3) -> (gw1 -> gw2 -> gw4 -> gw5)",1,05-16-2022,03:55 PM

253,485475,Adrian_Jensen,"So... at a network level, the portal and gateway are separate*. The GP client connects to the portal address, authenticates and downloads the GP client config, and then disconnects. The GP client then looks at the gateway addresses designated in the config (Network->GlobalProtect->Portals->[portal]->Agent->[cfg]->External Gateways), picks the best, and then tries to connect and authenticate against a designated gateway address. Most people have a one-to-one portal-gateway relationship, but you can have a one-to-many relationship as well.* - The portal and gateway can run on the same IP, different IPs on the same PA, or completely separate PAs. There are a few gotchas depending on how its separated.I am currently running 2 PAs, 2 WAN interfaces on each PA, 4 portals and 4 gateways total. GP clients connects to any portal, authenticates, then goes to any of the 4 gateways (I have depreferenced the gateway on our main portal address, that almost everyone initially connects to, so they nearly always get shuffled to a gateway on a different WAN/PA with less traffic).If you already have a gateway on gp1.acme.com, you don't need to add a second gateway to receive clients from gp2.acme.com. Just change the portal ""External Gateways"" client config on gp2.acme.com to point to gp1.acme.com (or point to both gp1 and gp2 with a priority setting).For authentication, both the portal and gateway have authentication setups. Depending on how you have setup your auth, you may need to make some changes. A few examples: 1) If you are using automatic SSO you probably won't notice any difference. 2) If you are using user/pass on the portal and generating an auth cookie for auto-login to the gateway (no second user/pass prompt), you will need to make sure gp1. and gp2. have the same trusted root cert used to generate/verify the cookie (also make sure they are time synced). 3) If you are using cert authentication you need to ensure you have the same certificates on both**.** - I found a bug/caveat that I can't find documented anywhere. If you have the portal and gateway on the same IP, the gateway server SSL/TLS Profile and authentication Client/Certificate Profile overwrites a portion of the portal profiles... So if you try to do certificate authentication on the portal and user/pass authentication on the gateway, it will never work.... You have to have portal and gateway on separate IPs if you want to do certificate authentication on one and user/pass authentication on the other.",0,05-06-2022,01:39 PM

You can use the portal to upgrade clients and control who gets upgraded!

I always test the release myself, with my specific ""use cases"" of what must work. I then add some IS staff who have admin rights so if something goes wrong they can recover on their own. Then I move on to picking one model of each PC with one person for testing. Since we moved to this process for upgrades things have been smooth sailing ( knock on wood).",1,05-06-2022,12:16 PM

270,218679,kmuellercm,"I had a very similar issue with pre-login (always on) connections, tunnel rename, and RADIUS-based MFA. Our portal login profile only requires username/password, but our gateways require MFA. We also had the ""pre-login tunnel rename timeout"" set to the default of -1 and users were experiencing all sorts of problems connecting after login.Setting the pre-login tunnel rename timeout to 0 solved it (since you're requiring MFA during gateway login, there's no point in renaming the tunnel). So users are re-prompted for credentials and the MFA passes correctly.I don't know if tunnel rename is supposed to work with MFA gateways and pre-login, but intuitively it really should not. PA's guidance seems to be only set the timeout to 0 when using pre-login then on-demand, but with MFA, I don't think the tunnel rename actually works correctly.",0,07-29-2021,05:59 AM
271,218679,vsys_remo,@kmuellercmthe description of your setup sound like there should be something changed. I would use MFA already for the portal and then use authentication cookies for the gateway in order to ask the users only once for credentials. For security reasons on the gateway you use the sam RADIUS MFA authentication profile for situations where the connection comes directly to the gateway without the portal. At least this way it works for me (I also experimented with the value 0 but this resulted for me in problems because of the tunnel IP chance between prelogon and the usertunnel). In addition to the userlogin to gp I use an user-id agent setup because with the active directory logs the user is known a lot earlier on the firewall than it would be with the gp login which takes place when already the desktop is completely there.,1,07-29-2021,10:23 AM

273,218679,kmuellercm,"The only thing that really changed was on the client-side (windows 10 upgraded to 20H2), but we couldn't find anything that the client was doing differently.The portal (from my understanding) authenticates each time the config refreshes, so MFA would prompt the end-user for credentials each time it refreshes. So I just use a RADIUS profile that only requires user/pass and don't issue cookies from the portal.Ultimately I want to replace this all with SAML-based login and pre-login VPN authentication, but that's a ways off.

337,477203,Adrian_Jensen,"Yes, both the Portal and the Gateway require authentication (otherwise someone could connect without credentials). The Portal provides the GP configuration to the client (or a download of the client via HTTPS), the client then connects to the Gateway to actually setup the VPN tunnel and pass traffic. In most cases you will have the Portal and Gateway on the same interface, but in large setups they can be completely separate. Perhaps an east coast and west coast Portal, with Gateways spread all over the world (the config gives you some options to force a particular Gateway or allow the client to connect to different Gateways in a set based on what is the ""best"" connection seen from the client).For authentication against both the Portal and Gateway you have 3 choices:1) User/pass authentication via a variety of methods (SSO, Radius/LDAP, etc.).2) User or machine certificate.3) An authentication cookie.How you choose which method gets pretty deep into the weeds based on a whole slew of different configuration options in the Portal/Gateway/client. But if you are doing a simple on-demand VPN setup the you will probably want to setup user/pass on the Portal and cookie authentication on the Gateway. A simplified view of the steps is:- Create an Authentication Profile that will validate your VPN users (against LDAP/Radius/etc.).- Create a root certificate on the PA for signing (if you already have one for decryption/etc. you can use that)- Create a Portal on an interface and apply the user Authentication profile.- Under the Portal -> Agent settings select ""Generate cookie for authentication"" and select the root certificate.- Create a Gateway on aninterface and apply the user Authentication profile.- Under the Gateway -> Agent -> Client Settings create a client profile and under Authentication Override select ""Accept cookie for authentication override"" with the root certificate. You may want to limit the lifetime the cookie is valid.After finishing the config with all the other options, your client should now be able to connect, prompt for user/pass against the Portal, download the config, and reconnect to the Gateway. The Portal should generate an authentication cookie for the GP client which will use it to automatically login to the Gateway. If the client disappears for away for a while and then tries to reconnect to the Gateway later, the cookie will no longer be valid and the client will be prompted from the Gateway for the user/pass again.",0,03-31-2022,05:26 PM
338,470633,Adrian_Jensen,"Some more testing has revealed an odd pattern:1) Laptop not currently connected to any network, first ever attempt to connect to new Wifi-Internal:Connects to Wifi-Internal with cert, gets DHCP, GP client recognizes internal host, switches to Connected-Internal. Can disconnect/reconnect to Wifi-Internal and works correctly.2) Reboot laptop, or take laptop home and connect via normal VPN, bring laptop back to office and try to connect to Wifi-Internal:Connects to Wifi-Internal with cert, gets DHCP, GP client does not recognize internal host, prompts for VPN login.3) Connect laptop to Wifi-Public, connect to VPN, switch from Wifi-Public to Wifi-Internal without logging out/disconnecting from VPN:Connects to Wifi-Internal with cert, gets DHCP, GP client recognizes internal host, switches to Connected-Internal.4) Connect laptop to Wifi-Public, connect to VPN, disconnect from VPN, switch from Wifi-Public to Wifi-Internal:Connects to Wifi-Internal with cert, gets DHCP, GP client does not recognize internal host,prompts for VPN login.",0,03-04-2022,03:51 PM
339,470633,Adrian_Jensen,"Bump... Still fighting with this, detection is still very sporadic. If you are currently connected to the VPN and switch to the internal network (switch Wifi networks, suspend laptop offsite and come onsite and connect the internal network, etc.) then it auto-detects and goes to internal mode. But if you disconnect from the VPN (disconnect, select a different portal, reboot PC, etc.) and then join the internal network, it will sit forever at the VPN auth prompt.PanGPS logs show no indication of DnsQuery happening on internal network and packet dumps show lots of DNS traffic, but not the host detection query (I can manually query DNS successfully from the internal network).",0,03-08-2022,12:52 PM
340,470633,Adrian_Jensen,"So... This is sill working intermittently. We have found that if you explicitly login to the Portal first, the GP Client will do the internal host detection and show ""Connected - Internal"". However if join the internal network after a power off/reboot, or some time away on the external gateway, the GP Client will usually not do an internal host detection.PA support is now telling us that you have to log into the Portal every time, before the GP Client will do internal host detection. Is this right? You have to be connected to the Portal before the client will even attempt to determine if it is on an internal network? What is the point of having an internal network detection then, if you have to login anyways?Logging into the Portal first is a problem for us, and a challenge for end users to move from network to network, as we require a full MFA login and there are places in the building where cell coverage does not work...",0,03-10-2022,01:52 PM
341,470633,MickBall,Yes this is the correct behaviour.Internal host detection was originally added to determine whether internal or external gateways should be used but has become a convenient way to prevent external gateway connection when connected to the corp lan (By not actually entering any internal gateways). Could you not use cert auth to the portal and MFA to GW when prompted… or select your current app config to “on demand”.,0,03-13-2022,01:35 AM
342,470633,Adrian_Jensen,"I had previously tried to get cert auth to the portal working (to then move MFA to the GW) and could not, both the GP client and a browser would fail to submit the user or machine cert to the portal and then login would fail with a ""Valid client cert is required"". I had a support ticket open but never got anything useful on it and gave up... My certs work fine for internal Wifi auth.Do to Infosec policies, I am required to do multiple things which make working around the tendency of the GP client to cache creds/try to autologin a pain.- always-on vpn- no autologin- MFA login (thru third party)- automatic disconnect after x hours- management doesn't want dual login prompts",0,03-14-2022,08:56 AM

348,378425,Astardzhiev,"Hey @AFaugno ,I am curious if you find solution to your problem? It seems we may experience the same think.Starting from PanOS 9.1 GlobalProtect logging was enhanced and moved to dedicate logs type/section. Before that they were subtype of System logs. So now if we want to forward GP logs to external we need to add it to the Device -> Log Settings config and specific GP logs to be forwarded to the syslog server.In addition under Device -> Syslog Server Profile -> Custom Format there is new type that needs to be re-formatted to use CEF format.The bizarre think is that GlobalProtect is not defined in the CEF guide for 9.1 PAN-OS 9.1 CEF Configuration Guide (paloaltonetworks.com)It is mentioned for 10.0 - MF_ Palo Alto Networks_NGFW_PANOS 10.0 _ArcSight_CEF_Integration_Guide Unfortunately using GP CEF format for 10.0 in 9.1 may be a problem as we still don't see GP CEF logs in SIEM after configuring it according to above steps.I am wondering if anyone else have similar issue.",0,03-18-2022,10:04 AM
349,378425,Astardzhiev,"I am writing this here if someone else face any issues with forwarding logs in CEF format.It seems the documentation for CEF formatting here have several issues Common Event Format (CEF) Configuration Guides (paloaltonetworks.com)1. Dedicated GlobalProtect log type was introdused in PanOS 9.1, but this type format is missing from 9.1 CEF format guide2. GP format log can be found in 10.0 format guide, but it has several issues which could cause parsing issues and missing this type of logs in your SIEM- GP logs were greatly enhanced in 10.0 and there are several log fields which are not supported by 9.1, so even that you can commit without issues, there is no point adding extra empty log fields- CEF requires strict format of the prefix fields. Every log needs to start with ""cef-version|vendor|product|os-version|subtype|type|severity|"". GP logs doesn't really have severity, but we will need to provide something in order for the logs to be parsed correctly. As mentioned in the documentation you should use ""1"" for all log types for which severity is irrelevant. Most of the CEF syslog servers will run regex check to confirm proper CEF formatting before parsing the log and since severity is missing from GP log type format, those logs will not be parased and stored by your SIEM.- Documentation is using ""receive_time"", but it is better to use ""cef-formatted-receive_time"" to be sure that all of the log timestamps are correct- Since GP logs (at least for 9.1) doesn't really have subtype, it value will always be 0, which doesn't provide any information, I would suggest to use ""eventid"" in the prefix instead.- It is a bit annoying that none of the GP log fields are actually mappted to any of the standard CEF extentions fields. This is not actually a problem, since the information is still there, but in my case grabbing the interesting information from those fields requires additional parsing.I have played for a while and came up with GP log fromat of my own.You can change it according to your needs, but what is most important is to use correct prefix format, if not GP logs will not be parsed by CEF syslog server",0,03-24-2022,01:59 AM

I configured 1 portal with 2 gateways and 1 certificate for a customer using this method -> https://knowledgebase.paloaltonetworks.com/KCSArticleDetail?id=kA10g000000ClUhCAK. This technique is not well known. The FQDN is the same, but the port numbers are different. A NAT rule is used to NAT traffic to the different gateway IP.

Again, that doesn't seem to be documented.If you have two separate portals (one for each ISP) that only forward traffic to one gateway (on the same ISP) then I don't see why it wouldn't work. They should act independently without a conflict in FQDN or certificate.It would be cool if you could test it and let us know. If you have ECMP, you need to enable symmetric return.Thanks,TomPS A more standard way of accomplishing this redundancy is to use a public loopback address that is advertised to both ISPs.

(I have seen this in the PA where it receives a request on WAN1 1.2.3.2 and replies out the WAN2 7.8.9.2 interface with a source IP of 1.2.3.2, getting dropped as a bogon by ISP2.)2) Are you pointing the client address somewhere else in the routing table? I.e. reply goes to an address that actually routes to your internal/etc. interface.3) Are you using a blacklist on input/output.

If it receives the expected hostname as a response, the agent assumes it is on an internal network and connects to the gateways in theinternal list.•If no response is received for the lookup, the client connects to the gateways in the external list.

When you first connect on windows there’s two user-id entries in the monitor tab from source: vpn-client and GlobalProtect. So initially there are hits to AD from domain.com\username which falls under a different access policy. Once they hit any of our 4 AD servers, they update user-id with domain\username which now they can hit the appropriate policy.On a Mac client that is not intergrated with AD, user-id always sees them as domain.com\username so then they will never fall into appropriate user groups.

We went to that certificate profile and the third field down is User Domain. It was set to our domain in this format: domain.com. We basically threw a hail mary here and changed it to just domain.. After reconnecting we finally saw non-domain machines such as iPhone and mac test equipment finally match the user ID in username@domain.com format and hit on the actual policy we have tied to that AD group the user lives in.

441,323232,NeilR,"We had this issue as well recently. We are using the 5.1-13 client. Two different WIN 10 users on both Pro and Enterprise. I suspect some recent change on Win 10 is interacting with GP, and not allowing the stack to connect. Even when the user has admin rights uninstall/reinstall did not fix unless done by the Administrator account. Where this is an issue is because we don’t give local administrator account access to users. So the admininstrator login doesn’t work for remote support.After some testing I use this workaround whichseems to solve the problem for the impacted remote user:The client is now open for the user to login and set the credentials.As the remote users are isolated mostly this is less a short term issue.

454,401972,ShaiW,"HiStart on the client, check the \Program Files\Palo Alto Networks\GlobalProtect\PANgps.log - you should see if the client is (or not) trying to connect via IPsec, or falling back to SSL.You can also check if the client does not have anything blocking outgoing IPSEC from his location/s.On the firewall - kind reminder that this traffic usually is source=internet zone; destination=internet zone and that the default rule here is Intrazone default (2nd from last rule). Also these rules by default do NOT have log at session end enabled so this could be why you do not see logs. You have not written the loopback assigned zone name - this will impact which rule is being hit.You can also try a packet capture on the firewall - filter by a single test client source IP and see what ports exactly are being received.If you are using a loopback because you want GP to listen on a different IP than the Interface default, for example the Interface is 203.0.113.20/24 and you want GP to listen on 203.0.113.55 - just add this IP in the IPv4 tab of the ethernet1/x (which will now show 203.0.113.20/24 and 203.0.113.55). This way you will be able to select this IP and Ethernet in the GP configuration pages and not use a loopback at all.Hope this help,Shai",0,04-26-2021,11:01 PM

As long as you have 10.0 or higher installed, you can generate a custom report with the Client Version that will give you all of the versions you have. You can customize that report with other fields like source user or machine name to narrow it down to user/computer for tracking down anyone that isn't running the version you want.Prior to 10.0 you would need to utilize HIP Objects to get the agent versions and keep track of it that way. You can still do reporting on match name and keep track of who isn't running the latest agent versions, you just have to built it out yourself and this method would demand you have a GlobalProtect subscription.",0,02-09-2022,07:51 PM

We used to simply run a install.bat-script to distribute these two files and the required registry keys remotely to machines that needed it.

I'm also fairly sure I updated the VR to make sure it had a route between the two as well as the security policy and PBF. I opened a support case with tech support to figure this out.,0,05-10-2021,04:59 PM
510,404619,MP18,@rmcraeThanks for updating us.Keep us posted what Tech figures out.Also on PC where you are trying to RDP should have RDP enabled.Regards,0,05-10-2021,05:02 PM
511,404619,mcrae,RDP to the target machine works when testing from another node in the same subnet so I've eliminated that. The configs have changed some at this point on the PA220 so my previous wire shark captures are no longer valid but traffic was previously reaching the target node but the target node was not able to return to the VPN client due to failing ARPs. We'll see how far we get tonight with trouble shooting.,0,05-10-2021,05:07 PM
512,404619,aurence64,"Hi,Sorry for the very late reply, that isn't actually what I meant, I was wondering if you had terminated the VPN in the same Zone as the RDP session was being created, as I said in the post the best practice would be to separate the two (separate zones, separate Subnets) but some people do not do this, so yes I quite agree that normally the two are different.",0,05-18-2021,09:03 AM

514,404619,aurence64,"Did you really not find a solution to this? I am sure we can figure what is happening as this should be a workable configuration, let me know if you want to continue trying to fix the issue.The problem I think is that logically speaking the VPN host is actually on a different interface to the host that you are trying to reach, so when the target .18 host tries to reply it simply arps out for the MAC address in standard way, I think that there should be a mechanism by which it can resolve the tunnel interface for the destination.",0,02-01-2022,01:45 AM

516,460671,BPry,"@thoffman,Whatever you were looking at must have been older. If you wish to block the device from connecting you would simply add it under Device -> Device Quarantine, and at that point the device won't be able to connect to GlobalProtect anymore.https://docs.paloaltonetworks.com/pan-os/10-0/pan-os-web-interface-help/device/device-device-quarant...If you're looking to block an individual user, regardless of device, there's a few ways you can do so:* Remove the user from the Gateway Agent configuration so they don't have a configuration to hand out. This would allow them to authenticate technically, but GlobalProtect won't connect as they don't have an assigned agent config.* Remove the user from the AD groups (assuming active directory) that actually power authentication. So as an example you might have a Authorized-VPN-Users security group that is attached to the Authentication Profile in the Allow List, simply remove that user from the associated groups.* Create a specific Agent configuration for this user, above all other configs in the list, that gives them a blocked IP Pool. Anyone assigned this agent config could be allocated an IP Pool that simply has a deny entry at the begining of your security rulebase as that while they'll be allowed to ""connect"", they can't process any network traffic.* Setup a deny rule and just target their User-ID entry as the source-user and deny all of the traffic from that User-ID coming across your GlobalProtect security zones.Removing them from the authentication profile so they simply can't authenticate is the ""correct"" answer for this, but any of these will technically work perfectly fine.",1,01-24-2022,11:10 AM

Have you looked at the PanGPS.log file on a machine that is failing to connect? That's the first spot I would go with an inconsistent issue like this.Since you've stated that you have some users working on any one of the gateways and some failing, we can assume that it isn't an actual configuration issue on the gateway in question. The one thing that may be different is the assigned client settings depending on what each user is assigned, so that's one thing to verify that could potentially be misconfigured. As long as you have working users in each though, it's far more likely to be an issue specific to the endpoints in question.",0,01-27-2022,07:33 AM

561,459882,BPry,"@rtangwai,Is there any reason that your actually disabling pre-logon once the user has logged on? Seems like a very simple fix would be to stop doing that and leaving pre-logon functional.As for your direct question, if you setup a simple IPSec tunnel you can configure it directly on a number of consumer routers can be configured to automatically bring the tunnel online and functional. Additionally you could utilize PA-220s for something like this without any issue, however depending on the number of units you would need itcouldbe more expensive than what you are looking for. Setup Ethernet1/1 as the DHCP ISP connection and Ethernet1/8 as the host connection and it would be simple enough to walk a user through getting things connected.Alternatively if you are using Prisma Access you could utilize the new Okyo Garde to form a tunnel for any connected device easily. This again isn't going to be the cheapest solution and I would be concerned about getting them to ship things back if you are already struggling getting equipment returned. It also requires that you have Prisma Access to get that functionality.",0,01-20-2022,09:48 AM

594,457811,Adrian_Jensen,"The client always seems to try the cookie first if it exists (at least in my testing, not sure if there is an GP client auth flowchart around). So if you have cookie gen in Gateway, then whenever the GP client successfully auths to the gateway it will get a new cookie. When the GP client tries to reconnect to the gateway either because of network disconnect, timeout, or VPN expiration, the client will try to reconnect to the gateway using the cookie. If that succeeds it gets a new cookie generated. If that fails it will try other auth methods. When the client tries to reconnect to the portal (every 24 hours by default I believe), it will also try to use the same cookie from the gateway for auth. Since you don't have accept cookie on the portal, that will always fail.From the System logs, you should be able to see where the portal and gateway are specifically generating/allowing/denying the cookie. Pay close attention to the Event field, it may be globalprotectportal-... or globalprotectgateway-..., but it all seems to blur together when I quickly look at it.( subtype eq globalprotect ) and ( description contains 'cookie' )There is a cookie lifetime on the portal and gateway auth override, but that seems to apply to the portal/gateway acceptance, the cookie seems to have an infinite lifetime on the client. Once given a cookie, the client will always try to use it until rebooted (I haven't found documentation or fully tested this, but it seems like what is happening).",1,01-11-2022,11:12 AM

611,455698,Adrian_Jensen,"We are doing the same authentication, external DUO via radius, and had the same problem with phantom DUO requests. Eventually we came up with a work around, but with a few caveats.1) GP Portal -> Authentication:  Setup your DUO authentication profile2) GP Portal -> Agent -> [profile] -> Authentication:  Create an Authentication Override, select ""Generate cookie for auth"" (do not accept a cookie for auth), use a self-gen cert.3) GP Portal -> Agent -> [profile] -> Authentication:  Under Components that Require Dynamic Passwords, check ""Portal"", ""External Gateway - manual"", and ""External Gateway - auto"".4)GP Portal -> Agent -> [profile] -> App:  Turn off Use Single Sign-On.5) GP Gateway -> Authentication:  Setup your DUO authentication profile.6) GP Gateway -> Agent -> Timeout Settings:  Set a shorter ""Login Lifetim""e interval for the gateway than the portal ""GP App Config Refresh Interval"" (under GP Portal -> Agent -> [profile] -> App).7) GP Gateway -> Agent -> Client settings-> [profile] -> Authentication Override:  Select ""Accept cookie for auth"" (not generate), set a very short cookie lifetime (a few minutes), and select the cert you generated the cookie from on the portal.So when you first connect, the GP client authenticates against the portal and get a DUO push. On successful auth the client gets pushed a cookie and immediately connects to the gateway, which bypasses the second DUO request there. When the gateway lifetime expires the client tries to reconnect automatically with the cookie and is rejected as expired. The client then prompts for user/pass do to the Dynamic Passwords override and waits for user input. You can re-enter your creds, get a DUO push from the gateway, and reconnect. When the portal refresh expires the client tries to reconnect to the portal automatically with the cookie and is rejected. As Dynamic Passwords is overriding, the portal will then prompt for user/passIF the gateway is not already connected AND the gateway refresh has not already prompted.Now the goofiness... Perhaps the biggest problem is that the portal can no longer refresh the GP client config. You will see the GP client try to automatically connect in the logs, but it is always rejected. In order to update the config you have to manually disconnect from the portal (disconnect or select a different portal if allowed) or reboot the PC. For users that always leave their PCs on/lock the PC and walk away with the VPN connected, this can create a problem with pushing portal/gateway config updates. Additionally, sometimes the user will briefly see the portal user/pass prompt after you have entered the gateway user/pass and are awaiting the DUO push to confirm. If you are fast and re-enter creds in that second prompt, thinking you mistyped the first, you will end up getting logged back out of the gateway and kicked all the way back to a new portal login.It's working for us to have a single DUO sign-on and not have phantom DUO requests on timeout, but its not perfect. Currently, I'm trying to get certificate authentication working on the portal, and have DUO just on the gateway, so the client could auto refresh configs at any time, but so far I can't seem to get the client to supply the cert....",2,12-28-2021,03:41 PM

Since your existing configuration works, I would give the new certificate the same name so I don't have to change the configuration.Depending on the CA, you should be able to get a new cert with the same private key. In which case you would not need to import the private key. This is a good doc for reference -> https://knowledgebase.paloaltonetworks.com/KCSArticleDetail?id=kA10g000000ClFoCAK.

The GlobalProtect subscription isn't done based off of users or sessions, once you have a license you have a license and it in and of itself doesn't have a user limit outside of the capabilities of your platform.In an active/active configuration the number of supported connections depends on how you have it deployed. If you're using floating IPs for the gateways you won't gain any additional capacity, however if you don't utilize a floating IP on the gateways and deploy a gateway on each firewall you would have a max capability of 1024 tunnels active on one and 1024 tunnels on the either (2048 total).Generally speaking people use floating IPs for the Portal and Gateway, but you don't necessarily need too. If you had a floating IP on the portal and setup a gateway on each peer you would technically be able to support more GlobalProtect connections than you would otherwise.

The portal uses our domain's wildcard cert.With the ECDSA certificate enabled on the gateway, Windows and MacOS, Android and iOS GP clients were able to connect to the gateway without issues. Linux clients, regardless of GP client version, would connect to the portal, authenticate the user, connect to the gateway, then error out with something along the lines of ""can't authenticate server"" when it went to establish the SSL connection to the gateway. The really interesting part was that manually loading https://gateway.address/whatever-the-pre-flight-URL-isin a web browser on the same Linux station worked. It was just the GP connection that failed.Nothing in the gateway configuration on the firewall changed, except which certificate was in use (RSA or ECDSA). We flipped it back to RSA, and Linux clients could connect without issue. Flipped it back to ECDSA, Linux clients would not connect. We even configured 1 gateway with RSA certs and another gateway with ECDSA certs, and would either get a working connection or a failed connection based on which username we logged in with (the username determines which gateway is used).Tried with GP 5.1.x, 5.2.x, and 5.3.x and the results were the same. Linux clients could not authenticate the gateway and would not establish a connection if the gateway used ECDSA certificates.We've since moved back to RSA certificates for everything on our firewalls, and won't be looking into ECDSA anytime in the future.

645,445955,ShaiW,"HiI have some thoughts about debugging this a little further:1. Can you try to disable IPv6 binding on your OS? In windows run ncpa.cpl, right click & properties of 'PANGP virtual Ethernet adapter' (or Ethernet 3) and unselect IPv6 binding. This should completely remove IPv6. Reboot and test.2. Bring to your IT's knowledge this configuration:In your Globalprotect portal configuration, 'Resolve All FQDNs Using DNS Servers Assigned by the Tunnel (Windows Only)' option if set to 'Yes' - will enforce the client machine to resolve all the DNS queries through the tunnel.If set to 'No'. This allows Windows endpoints to send DNS queries to the DNS server set on the physical adapter if the initial query to the DNS server configured on the gateway is not resolved. This option retains the native Windows behavior to query all DNS servers on all adapters recursively but can result in long wait times to resolve some DNS queries.The first item is on your workstation and can be tested locally but the second item could potentially affect all users. I think your IT can see if this is the cause of your issues by nslookup commands on your workstation in ETH/WiFi mode.

This means that every freaking https site on the internet will trigger browser error. I cannot believe this is real...Are you sure hotel is doing SSL decryption? Aren't they doing some kind of captive portal, that it will redirect any web request from the uers to the captive portal for either accepting the terms of use or authenticating.

802,409577,vsys_remo,"Hi @nikoolayy1I think @Astardzhievis pointing to the right direction. I also assume the reason for the connection problems is because of captive portals. Depending which GP version you use this captive portal detection is working really good - as long as you are using a supported version (5.1 or 5.2). Prior to these versions we had some situations which lead to problems with this detection in combination with the captive portal detection of windows.Anyway, if your problems are also because of captive portals then there are some settings which you need to check:Depending on the other settings you use in your environment not all of the above settings are relevant.",1,05-27-2021,09:27 AM
803,409577,nikoolayy1,"Thanks for your replies. The message we see is when the user connects to the gateway not the portal, so the option with allowing an invalid portal certificate may not help us and we have ""Captive Portal Exception Timeout"" configured as for the hotel paid Wi-Fi option there were no such issues and it also had captive portal that needed confirmation.Maybe it could be that the other options could help as the certificate error was about wrong CN in certificate not wrong CA as it should be for the normal SSL certificate emulation.I will do some captures and test your suggestions but just to ask if when the palo alto globalprotect app/agent is connecting to the globalprotect gateway is there a way to start directly with ipsec without any SSL/HTTPS traffic before that?",0,05-27-2021,12:26 PM
804,409577,vsys_remo,"Hi @nikoolayy1Even after your last comment I believe in the csptive portal theory. Here's why: the captive portal tries to redirect to the loginwebsite. Captive portals also do this for https traffic which could be the explanation that you see certificate mismatch errors. With such a captive portal often there is only port 80 and 443 allowed - at least prior to login. So ... gp is not able to connect to the portal which it does by default as a first step. If there is a cached gateway, gp continues to connect there. As you set it to prefer ipsec it tries this. If ipsec is blocked in this wifi network, then gp does a fallback to tls - which the captive portal redirecta again to the loginwebsite. So far about my theory. Obviously I don't know your situation exactly. Did you or one of your user try to connect - without vpn - to your portal website in the browser or another website? A good test website in such a case is http://neverssl.com .",1,05-27-2021,01:10 PM
805,409577,nikoolayy1,I will test this if it is a portal and why the portal for the free wi-fi does not get detected and inform you about what we see. Maybe also because we have client ssl authentication even if the ipsec is not blocked the application will need first to use ssl traffic and then switch to ipsec.,0,05-27-2021,01:53 PM

807,409577,nikoolayy1,"Extra issues I have found are:%%%%%%%%%%Many times when there is captive portal with ssl self-signed certificate if it is not confirmed the Globalprotect Agent will also show an error that the gateway/portal certificate is wrong/self signed.

902,434583,TomYoung,"Hi @Dereje ,What you are describing is a very standard way of doing things with Cisco AnyConnect. Because GlobalProtect (GP) users are automatically added to User-ID (the NGFW knows their name and IP at login), the firewall rules do not have to permit or deny users based on the IP pool. You can replace the IP pools in the firewall rules with user groups. In that way, if a user is a member of multiple groups, they will match multiple rules and have all the access they need without having to select (or change) a profile. The only piece you need to add (if you haven't done so already) is group mapping via LDAP or the Cloud Identity Engine (PAN-OS 10.1). For group mapping, make sure you configure the Primary Username under User Attributes because it will standardize the format of users so that it is consistent across multiple User-ID sources.You can assign separate IP pools based upon groups under the GP gateway > Agent > Client Settings, but I do not know how users can select their own ""profile.""Thanks,Tom",3,09-16-2021,07:02 PM

Please check below concern,When GP portal has multiple Gateways, if Gateway with highest priority gets down and its not coming up, then Gateway with less priority with respect to highest one will address/assess all GP clients traffic. So, while this happen , whether users have to enter their credentials again in their GP client Application to get authenticated in order keep using GP ssl-vpn ? ( While 2nd Gateway with less priority with respect to highest one takes over, does it remain transparent to end users ? While this failover happens whether GP portal/GP client application asks/forces users to authenticate again for continuing to use GP ssl-vpn ?For GP end users , how we can have auto failover between multiple gateways in above scenario so that users do not have to authenticate again or users need not to put their GP credentials in their GP client application in continuation to use GP ssl-vpn ?Thanks in advance !!Shiva Vaishya",0,08-29-2021,09:05 PM

The firewall can scan this traffic and you can apply rules as such.The problem here is all other traffic, like general web browsing, is egressing from the endpoint to the ISP and not through the NGFW.Simple put the endpoint has 2 connections - 1 for the office and the other for everything else.Full tunneling means you route EVERYTHING into the NGFW, via security rules and scanning profiles, just like if the endpoint would be inside the corporate network.

946,428395,Astardzhiev,"Hi @rabbyx7xafc ,You shouldn't be able to use two differnt gateways associated with same tunnel interface.Put it this way - if you imagine that tunnel.1 is just a simple IPsec tunnel (site to site), using two gateways is like building site to site with two different peers using same interface and routes. What I am trying to say is that firewall will not be able to determen which gateway should it use, because you will have two different IP pools associated with same interface.What you could to is:- Create two separate gateways each assosiated with different tunnel interface, different IP pool. You could use the same SSL certificate and configure, so your GP portal use one FQDN for GP gateway and have your DNS to resolve it with primary and backup IP. Or configure GP portal to send two gateways with different priority and let the gp client detect when there is issue with primary- Assing the GP gateway and portal IP address to loopback IP. Configure BGP with both of your ISP and advertise it from both. Configure single GP portal and gateway using the loopback. Leave the failover to the BGP and the ISPs",1,08-23-2021,12:51 AM
947,428395,abbyx7xafc,"okay got it! but here is my confusion. I don't see any option to use FQDN for setting up the GP portal! its only IPv4 or IPv6. As i'm seeking redundancy, how can I ensure that if my GP Portal is dependant on IP only, and if that ISP goes down, so does GP portal.",0,08-23-2021,01:07 AM
948,428395,abbyx7xafc,"as seen here, no option to choose FQDN",0,08-23-2021,01:09 AM
949,428395,Astardzhiev,"Hi @rabbyx7xafc ,That is correct, and if you think about it make sense. When you selecting IP address for GP gateway portal, you are telling the firewall on what socket to listen for connections. You cannot configure network socket with FQDN, right.Take one step back to how GP works:1. When user (aka gp client) wants to connect he will make a connection to the portal first.2. User puts FQDN in the GP client, it resolves to an IP and then it tries to connect to that IP3. Once connected and authenticated to the portal gp client will download instructions/settings for GP application behaviour and how to establish the VPN tunnel. This will include the GP gateway (the endpoint to which the gp client will try to establish vpn tunnel)4. In here your should put the FQDN for your GP gateway.GP client will get this FQDN and again resolve it to get the IP to which it should connect.In most cases people tend to use same IP and FQDN for gateway and portal, but again depends on your setup.Now back to your question - how to configure redundancy for your GlobalProtect. If you notice above, in order for your VPN to work you need to have redundency for both portal and gateway.From what I understand you are using two different ISPs, so my suggestions would be:1. Create two separate GP deployments (portal and gateway). Each one associated with public IP from each ISP. When creating your DNS entry you need to use DNS failover service, which will monitor status for both GPs and resolve the FQDN to the primary and if it is down to the secondary ISP ip address.2. Get public IP range that is assigned to your. Run BGP with both ISP and advertise this range to both ISP. Configure some IP addresses as loopback interfaces and use those for one portal and gateway. Configure your GP FQDN to resolve to this one. So the DNS will always resolve to same IP, but if your ISP one is down BGP will advetise your public range via ISP two.2.",0,08-23-2021,02:28 AM
950,428395,abbyx7xafc,"ok got it. can you make one thing clear? is this true that if the ISP im using for GP PORTAL goes down, it doesnt matter as long as the GP gateway behind that portal are up? i just read that GP PORTAL just initially sends the client info regarding how to connect to GW. after thaat, it wont matter that GP portal ip is up or not. is this correct?",0,08-23-2021,03:43 AM
951,428395,Astardzhiev,"Hey @rabbyx7xafc ,If GP Gateway is UP, your currently connected users will continue to work normally, but most probably users will not be able to establish new connections.I am saying ""most probably"" because by design gp client will cache the settings and when restarted it will first try to use the ""last known"" working settings and gateway and connect straight to the GP gateway (without any attempts to connect to GP portal). I am not 100% sure, but I believe this is only valid for Always-On VPN connection. With One-Demand (I believe) it will always try to connect to portal and only after successful connection it will try to connect to the GP gateways.Don't forget also that, once user is connected to GP gateway it will periodically connect to GP portal to check if there is change in the application config. Not sure what was the default, but something like every 6-8 hours. I am not sure what will happen if user is connected to GP gateway and try to refresh portal config - I assume nothing, user should stay connected without issues but still good to have it in mind.Are you planning to use the GP with Always-On or On-Demand mode?",0,08-23-2021,04:16 AM

IPSec is susceptible to disruptions, so an issue on your WAN connection that you maybe wouldn't notice in the office can become a severe issue while working remotely.The second issue that you would want to look at is if your system is logging any zone or DoS alerts during the same time period, or do you even have these features configured. With everyone working remotely I've seen a lot of instances where folks forget about re-analyzing these features and start hitting activate and maximum rates that they aren't actually alerting on.That's the first two things that I would look at.

This only shows how to setup Okta saml authentication for GlobalProtect clientless vpn and how to create a bookmark that will allow a workaround for IDP initiated workflow. What this thread is talking about it allowing you to use SSO between different SP(service provider) applications configured in the same IDP. I have tried this with both Okta and Keycloak. I think the reason this does not work is because the firewall does not receive the session cookies that tell the IDP that it is the same session as the application trying to SSO to.

This can be pulled from the Policies tab as MickBall suggested.The piece that was tripping me up is that we are using SAML for authentication and the user group mapping that was setup prior to myself working in the system had a manually defined domain in the user domain field using the FQDN.Turns out this was not allowing the firewall to properly match the user account to the group for non-policy mappings. So policies would work just fine, but GP portal and gateway mapping never worked.

If your default route is via the vpn then on a Windoze device.... no chance... a constant droll of netbios smb dns av updates email refresh blahdy blahhh. Will certainly keep the timer in check.it would be more likely to work if you use split tunnel and only had access routes to your internal servers then all the other junk would stay local.i do not use this as we are set to always on... so i just set inactivity timer to 3 hours so it will boot off those who just power off their devices without logging off first.

1177,408400,gvyskocil,"Thanks for the replies. I guess I was confused on the setup for decryption. For outbound I thought I needed to configure SSL forward proxy and best practice is to use a enterprise CA as forward trust certificate. As both posters noted, that is a internal enterprise CA, not a public one as I though I might use. Or I can just use self signed certificates from the firewall. Then it looks like I need a different certificate for a forward untrust certificate. I will probably just use self signed on both for now. I was getting confused as inbound traffic is part of web traffic but looks like the key is the session itself starts as outgoing. The traffic only starts when an internal user requests an external website and I need to look at that as outbound.SSL inbound inspection would be if I have some internal server that people access from outside? For that part can I use the wildcard cert? I have a public cert that server uses for TLS that I am looking at switching to the wildcard cert.Thanks again for the replies.

If I change the config so that that external Portal and Gateway are on the same IP the change is very quick. This happens both for Log off and logon.

1207,338035,ksalustro,"Fabiano's suggestions did not work for me since I was already not using auth cookies. By default, the user's tunnel will be renamed and they will stay on the same gateway. But, perhaps you have a windows user group and you want them to get directed to a 2nd gateway. If you do refresh connection, they will switch, but you want it to happen automatically.So, consider setting this timeout value for the pre-logon tunnel, under App settings, to 0:Pre-Logon Tunnel Rename Timeout (sec) (Windows Only)This setting controls how GlobalProtect handles the pre-logon tunnel that connects an endpoint to the gateway.A value of -1 means the pre-logon tunnel does not time out after a user logs on to the endpoint; GlobalProtect renames the tunnel to reassign it to the user. However, the tunnel persists even if the renaming fails or if the user does not log in to the GlobalProtect gateway.A value of 0 means when the user logs on to the endpoint, GlobalProtect immediately terminates the pre-logon tunnel instead of renaming it. In this case, GlobalProtect initiates a new tunnel for the user instead of allowing the user to connect over the pre-logon tunnel. Typically, this setting is most useful when you set the Connect Method to Pre-logon then On-demand, which forces the user to manually initiate the connection after the initial logon.",0,05-27-2021,09:13 PM

1235,406078,BPry,"@GeorgePalo,Ya by default this wouldn't work. The problem is that your firewall doesn't know who the user is when a user is attempting to connect from untrust to your GlobalProtect portal/gateway. So the SSL_VPN_IN is never going to be matched and you'll always hit the Block-In entry. For this to work, you would need to tie it with an authentication rulebase entry to feed unidentified users attempting to access GlobalProtect and have them login so that they actually have a user-id mapping on their public IP so they match your SSL_VPN_IN entry.I honestly don't recommend you try do anything like this. Let your GlobalProtect Portal do it's job of authenticating the users. If you want to secure it as much as possible, restrict access to regions that you expect/allow users to work from and setup an automatic block for the source address after X number of GlobalProtect authentication failures.",1,05-11-2021,07:29 AM

All internal domains are set to be resolved by our internal AD servers. The only item we don't have configured is an internal record for vpn.example.com. However I fail to see how this could suddenly break the split tunnel DNS resolution.Side note: I'm very surprised that GP only has an opt-out mechanism for DNS queries and it maxes at 300.

If you start running out of addresses in your address pool, the firewall will start re-assigning addresses from disconnected clients.

It installs routes into the route table to handle the actual traffic routing so the endpoint knows how to route traffic.

This would effectively just make it so they aren't able to pass any traffic if they don't have the DLP agent installed.

1428,383978,vathreya,This might be conflicting with the always-on feature introduced in Chrome Admin Console. Could you put in a TAC case so that they can review and let you know next steps?,0,02-10-2021,04:19 PM
1429,383978,LCMember319,Which part do you think is conflicting? The Always On on theGoogle Admin Console and the JSONentry?I opened a TAC case and they are saying that when using SAML there is no way to launch GlobalProtect automatically. I don't get why the limitation is there with SAML.I have tested the Always On setting in the Google Admin console with SAML and it doesn't work because that setting does not allow any internet access until the VPN is connected. I also have tested the Always On Google Admin Console setting via a LDAP service account. I supply the service account's username and password in the JSON values of the app in Google Admin Console. This works but it takes about 30 seconds to a minute for the VPN to connect on the Chromebook and during that 30 seconds to a minute the user has no internet. This is a work around but it is still not a complete solution if you ask me. I wish there was some way via JSON values to tell GlobalProtect to start as soon as it is installed and be Always On without the need to set the Always On setting in the Google Admin console. This is the way it works on Windows via msi package parameters. Wish Palo can get this working on Chrome OS.,0,02-10-2021,09:21 PM

1431,366472,MBCL88,"is there some tutorial how to do it? i have direct access, but i dont see there any button or something where i can update agent bundle etc?",0,12-01-2020,06:56 AM
1432,366472,BPry,"@MBCL88,On the GUI:1) Go to the Device tab2) Go to the GlobalProtect Client on the bottom left3) This is where you can download and activate any of the available agent bundles.On the CLI:Keep in mind if running in an HA pair or if you have multiple gateways you'll want to have the same agent bundle on all of them. You can jump directly from any agent bundle to the next, there's no intermediate upgrades or anything like that.",1,12-01-2020,07:36 AM

I get ""Gateway GlobalProtect GW IP: Could not connect to the GlobalProtect gateway. Please contact your IT administrator"". Just to make sure, I use the correct portal IP and user name and password.Thank you all for your help, Barak.",0,12-21-2020,04:10 AM
1435,366472,BPry,"@barakb,Just to be clear, the upgrade did fix OPs issue as evident in their last update following the upgrade to 5.2.3. Because you transitioned from a broken 4.1.13 image and did an upgrade to 5.2.3, the first thing I'd have you try is to do a clean install of GlobalProtect 5.2.3 (Uninstall your existing installation completely, then re-install the 5.2.3 package). If that doesn't fix your issue let me know.",0,12-21-2020,03:24 PM
1436,366472,barakb,Hi again@BPryUnfortunately uninstalling and reinstalling didn't work 😞,0,12-22-2020,05:17 AM
1437,366472,BPry,"@barakb,So two things to check:1) Look at the PanGPS.log file and see what it's actually stating as far as the gateway connection. It could be that it can't validate something on the actual gateway, that it simply can't reach the gateway, or something similar. The logs are stored at /Library/Logs/PaloAltoNetworks/GlobalProtect/.2) Be mindful of the recent SSL lifetime changes Apple has put into place. Your lifetime is capped at 398 days effective September 1st on new certificates and the way that Apple severs the connection makes it appear to GlobalProtect that the connection can't be established, not specifically that the certificate is invalid.",0,12-22-2020,09:11 AM

The gateway thinks it did not receive HIP checks, starts sending keepalives.Now this is a point where we don't fully understand what's happening. When the gateway does send a keepalive according to the capture, nothing comes back. Regardless of the suggestion that the HIPS check would indeed be sent to the other firewall.

You need to make sure Remote VPN client pool should be routable through the IPSEC VPN to get access to other end server from remote VPN.c. If not possible to allow remote VPN client pool via IPSEC, then you need to do source NAT on the PA220 firewall and NAT all the traffic coming from Remote VPN Pool with one of the IP from the IPSEC encryption domain then send it to the tunnel. (I guess you have already mentioned point b & c in your post).d. You need to have appropriate security policies and NAT (as given above) to established the connectivity.3). Does this require a specific license? –For such topology, does not require any special license.Hope it helps!Mayur",1,12-03-2020,09:07 AM

Is it fiber/cable and what speed do you currently have are they dedicated or best effort?Have you taken a look at your current bandwidth utilization are you spiking or near capacity?How many users do you expect need this VPN access?What applications are your remote users going to be using over this vpn?What kind of bandwidth are you expecting per vpn user to be using?Whats the budget for this project?,0,12-09-2020,08:26 PM

1653,350419,khans,"Yes, you can use SAML on the firewall 3 gateway, But in this scenario Portal will have a different authentication method then gateway, so the user might be prompted twice to authenticate.Best would be to have both Portal and gateway to use the same SAML authentication profile, so the user is only prompted once to authenticate to the IdP and GP client then just pass the auth to the gateway.SAML response from the IdP will have Name ID and/or SAML Attributes for usernames that can be used to limit users via allow list in the authentication profile.I would also recommend looking into the new GP client 5.2, as it has an additional feature for SAML ""Use Default Browser for SAML Authentication"". This will allow the GP client to use the default user browser, so users don't have to input credentials, as the default browser can save them.Here is a good KB for troubleshooting SAML issues:https://knowledgebase.paloaltonetworks.com/KCSArticleDetail?id=kA10g000000ClVvCAKHope that helps!",1,09-25-2020,04:18 PM

Keep in mind that windows will generally keep anything with a private key in PFX format, but really all PFX means is that it's using PKCS#12. This is really easy to deploy, and as long as you have the certificate in the machine store and the firewall has a properly configured certificate profile assigned it'll ""just work"".The only gotcha that you should keep in mind with this change is that by default the agent option is set to search both the machine and user certificate stores. If you aren't setup to handle users will user certificates, you'll want to ensure that you have the agent configured to look solely at the machine store.",0,09-17-2020,09:30 PM

1687,334273,OwenFuller,"If I'm understanding what you are trying to do, you are trying to connect from your office computer to your home computer with RDP? Your home computer is likely not using a publicly routable IP address. Instead, it's probably using an address reserved for use on private networks such as 192.168.x.x or 10.x.x.x. You cannot find these on the Internet. They are only for use on internal networks. If this is the case, your router has a public IP address on the connection to your ISP, but hides all the private addresses on the inside using network address translation (NAT). In order to access the computer inside your network, you would have to enable port-forwarding on the router. The steps for doing this vary from one manufacturer to another, and if you are not very technical, you should probably have someone who is help you set this up.

You will need to change the server certificate in the SSL/TLS profile which is being used for the Portal and Gateway, then the Root and intermediate certificates can be added to the Portal config under Portal --> Agent --> Trusted Root CA, so they're trusted for the GP connection.If you wanted the user browser to trust the Root and Intermediate CA certificates alongside GP client, then you can also check the box next to the certificate ""Install in Local Root Certificate Store""Users should have permission to install the Root and Intermediate CAs to their local Trust Root Certificate Store.Let us know if that helpsThanks and stay safe!",1,06-18-2020,02:58 PM

1775,334142,khans,"Hi,PanOS supports SP initiated authentication for SAML, so when the user authenticates to the idP, the client will hold an SSO cookie, to authenticate all subsequent connections, hence SSO will work. But if the Cookie expires from the idP side and/or login lifetime has expired on the firewall, then the user will be initiated to authenticate again.You can extend the login time from your idP side, as well as the firewall Login Lifetime on the gateway side. If both of these are extended, then the user should be able to authenticate for a longer period of time, but they will still be prompted to authenticate once the SSO session expires. Currently, the GP client uses an embedded browser like IE for windows, and it can't use the SSO session from let's say Chrome browser, where the user might have already authenticated to the idp.Starting GP client 5.2, you will have the option to set a default browser for the user i.e. Chrome and it should allow GP client to use SSO session if the user has already authenticated to the idp.Let me know if that helps!Thanks and stay safe",0,06-18-2020,05:22 PM

Try the following:- Create a security policy allowing traffic from your Trust zone to your the public IP/FQDN of your GP portal in your Untrust zone allowing panos-global-protect as the application.- If normally NATing traffic from your Untrust to Trust zone, create a NAT policy whichexcludestraffic from your Untrust zone to your GP portal from being NATed.- Make sure your DNS server has a PTR record for the IP address you are using in the Internal Host Detection sectionof the portal config (i.e. you must be able to donslookup 10.0.0.1and get gpcheck.domain.local, or whatever internal record you are using).- Under Your Portal> Agent >Your Agent Config> Internal, make sure you check ""Internal Host Detection IPv4"" and put in the IP address and domain name for the PTR record you are using to determine that the client is on the local network.EDIT:I actually just considered that you could try connecting externally the first time you connect. Once the client has the portal config with the proper IP/hostname for the internal host check, it might not error out anymore. If you want to avoid the hassles though, do as I suggested above.",0,05-21-2020,11:11 AM
1815,329193,dfrancis,"I realized part of my problem was that I didn't have a DNS entry on my internal DNS servers for the GP portal, which explains why I got the error when trying to connect internally.As a temporary workaround I added that entry to the local hosts file on my computer (i.e. vpnx.example.com). I have the DNS name / IP address of a server on our network listed in the Internal Host Detection section (servername.mydomain.local 10.0.0.1) and I can do an nslookup on my machine of both the address and the DNS name and they match up. Shouldn't GP see that as part of the connection process and stop the connection vs. letting it connect?",0,05-21-2020,06:38 PM
1816,329193,OwenFuller,"""Shouldn't GP see that as part of the connection process and stop the connection vs. letting it connect?""Well, if the client can't reach the portal from inside the network, and the client connects from inside the network initially, it's not even going to get the portal config to tell it what the internal host check address is in the first place. You could also trigger this error if a users switches from an external to internal network (e.g. from mobile hotspot to corporate WiFi), and the client is configured to try to reconnect. This is also particularly problematic if you're using and ""always on"" connection method, as the client will attempt to reach the portal anytime. Rather than getting an error, you want it to connect to the portal to check for config updates, and then not connect to a gateway, at which point the client will say ""Connected - Internal"" instead of connected to a particular gateway.It's been awhile since I've done a new portal setup, so I don't recall the exact behavior, but I'm not sure you'll avoid getting the connection error if the portal isn't accessible. You should be able to experiment a little to determine what works though. Having setup portals a few different times now, I still suggest making them accessible from your internal network to avoid the most hangups and confusion to users. If you're not doing desktop SSO to pass the user's credentials to the client when they log into the OS, you can use cookies, and set the portal cookie timeout to a really high time (like a year), and use a much shorter time (like a few hours) on your gateway which is the more important thing to secure since it actually terminates the VPN tunnel. This will keep users from being prompted to authenticate to the portal when if GP tries to connect while on the corporate network.",0,05-22-2020,06:49 AM
1817,329193,dfrancis,"Well crap. I finally ran across the ""GlobalProtect Not Detecting Internal Network With Interal Host Detection Enabled"" article and saw this footnote:""Note:Internal Host Detection is not supported when the Connect Method is On-Demand""...which is exactly what we're using.I think the only way I can tackle this is to create an ACL to drop any connections using the panos-global-protect app from the internal network to the portal/gateway (since they both reside on the same firewall). That would still allow internal clients to hit the portal, just not establish the connection to the gateway, yeah?",0,05-22-2020,08:21 AM
1818,329193,OwenFuller,"The KB you referenced is over two years old. I do not see that stipulation about not working w/ the on-demand connection method in the actual documentation for 9.0 nor 8.1, so I can't say for sure. It's been a couple of years since I worked with on-demand mode, but I was thinking the internal host detection still worked. I could be wrong though. I would still suggest opening up the access from your inside zone to your portal as I explained in my first reply, and testing out the internal host detection for yourself that way.If you simply drop panos-global-protect to the portal, I think you'll still be stuck with the the ""portal not found"" error, because I don't think the client will be unable to reach it at all. Since this is an on-demand connection, maybe that's acceptable, since users shouldn't see it unless they try to connect internally.",0,05-22-2020,01:43 PM
1819,328517,OwenFuller,"I don't think GP supports giving addresses to clients via DHCP. When clients connect to the gateway, they're forming a point-to-point tunnel. This tunnel has an IP address and a subnet mask of 255.255.255.255 that the client uses to identify the tunnel, and the tunnel interface on the firewall may not even have an IP address to use as a default gateway. It's not quite the same as just handing the client an address, subnet mask, gateway, etc. from DHCP in a traditional layer 3 network.These forum posts, while older, seem to support this, and I have never seen any documentation about using DHCP instead of IP pools on GP.https://live.paloaltonetworks.com/t5/general-topics/dhcp-relay-for-globalprotect/td-p/205699https://live.paloaltonetworks.com/t5/general-topics/global-protect-dhcp-config/td-p/228635",1,05-22-2020,07:21 AM
