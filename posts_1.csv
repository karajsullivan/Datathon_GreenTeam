This appears to be counter to every discussion, video tutorial (both PA sponsored and other), and best practices/benchmarks I have read/seen where IP Spoof protections are recommended to be enabled for all zones, including untrusted/Internet facing zones.      Am I mis-reading/understanding the documentation or is it really the case the 'Discard-IP-Spoof' is NOT recommended for a Zone Protection profile meant to be applied to an untrust/Internet facing zone? Thanks. Reference:https://docs.paloaltonetworks.com/pan-os/8-1/pan-os-web-interface-help/network/network-network-profi...https://docs.paloaltonetworks.com/pan-os/9-0/pan-os-web-interface-help/network/network-network-profi...https://docs.paloaltonetworks.com/pan-os/9-1/pan-os-web-interface-help/network/network-network-profi...https://docs.paloaltonetworks.com/pan-os/10-0/pan-os-web-interface-help/network/network-network-prof...https://docs.paloaltonetworks.com/pan-os/10-1/pan-os-web-interface-help/network/network-network-prof...",0,"

I want to upgrade the link speed from the internal firewall to the Switch as well as the Perimeter firewall to this same switch stack. Unfortunately, the FortiGate has run out of Cu ports and left only with Fiber SFP port. So If I have to leave this one as is i.e. only 2x1G Cu UTP to the switch. But the internal firewall has plenty of port space to expand the link aggregation from it to the switch so I was thinking of upgrading this from 2x1G to 4 or 8x1G. What is bothering me though is what would happen if a high-volume traffic as this connection is currently a point to point one in a nutshell if one removes the switch from the picture. How well will the interconnect/middle switch manage its job as one end has 4G link aggregate and the other end with 2G link aggregate?Appreciate all your insights!",0,"

14,468362,Best Practice Assessment Discussions,HKoppuravori,L0 Member,Migrate NAT policies from ASA to Palo Alto,"Hello All, I am trying to migrate Cisco ASA NAT policies to Palo Alto. I realized the packet processing in ASA is different from Palo Alto. On Cisco ASA, I will have two different NAT statements for source and destination. The packet when hits the firewall, the source, and destination are translated. However, in Palo Alto, if I do them in two rules either source or destination is translated based on the order of the rules. The only fix for this is to do SNAT and DNAT in the same rule in Palo Alto. This will be a huge task for us as we have around 7000 NAT policies on ASA and all these are related to VPN Tunnels. If I run the numbers, I think I will exceed the NAT policy limit for a 7050 chassis which is 16000 rules. This seems to be a huge amount of manual work. Any ideas are welcome and much appreciate your time and feedback.  ExamplesSource - 5.6.7.8 - DMZDestination - 10.1.1.1 - INSIDESNAT - 10.2.2.2DNAT - 144.144.155.155 Cisco ASA NAT Statement object network obj-10.1.1.1nat (INSIDE,DMZ) static 144.144.155.155 object network obj-5.6.7.8nat (DMZ,INSIDE) static 10.2.2.2 So the above two NAT statements are where both source and destinations are NATed. Cisco processes these NATs in a single transaction while Palo is unable to do it. I have so many tunnels and all IPs are NATed. On Palo Alto, I have to create rules manually for each and every tunnel. These amount to so many rules if there are more IPs routed thru a single tunnel.       ",0,"

Security Policy Service/URL Category or Actions > Profile Setting > URL Filtering?,"I'm trying to wrap my head around internet filtering.  Currently we use a Cisco Ironport WSA that uses WCCP between it and Cisco ASA5525X firewalls.  We ran the expedition project on the ASAs and have the config imported to Palo PA-3220s.  Since the Palo doesn't do WCCP, we will get rid of the Cisco Ironport WSA virtual machine that has policies and rules for web filtering. We have multiple IPs and ISP's, so right now we do have Global protect setup and our routing is configured so GP and Cisco Anyconnect VPN's can all coexist and access our core network...  but when we go live and eventually pull the plug on the Cisco ASA's and reconfigure our cores default gateway to the Palos, we have to figure out how to get web filtering working. We have 3 basic requirements and I'll lay them out from most restrictive to least restrictive. RestricedInternet - This only allows the bare-bones essentials.  Almost everything is blocked except Health and Wellness, Financial Services, government, reference and research, news, training and tools, and it turns out for Azure authentication and Adobe Acrobat license check, we also needed to allow low-risk and computer and internet info. Standard-Internet-NoSocial - This is pretty much the open internet WITHOUT Social Media. Open-Internet - This is like the policy above but it allows social media.  This would be applied to departments like Marketing, Executives, Supervisors. In ALL cases - all the bad stuff is set to block (malware, c2c, abortion, drugs,m adult, alcohol, copywriter infringement, etc...) So I have these configured in Objects > Security Profiles > URL Filtering.Then in Policies > Security we can trigger on the user's active directory group and apply it... however in a security policy rule there's the Service/URL Category tab and on the right side you can add all the denied categories and then in the Actions tab, configure the action to Deny.  What's the difference between doing this or setting the appropriate URL Filtering policy under the Profile settings in the actions tab? Is there also a way to match multiple security rules for Internet filtering?  Perhaps I want to allow Adobe Creative Cloud, MS-Update and Store, Office-365, etc.  All have their own line item in security policies, however, whichever one is on top it seems the test user I have in restricted internet ""hits on""... so I had to put their Restricted Internet ABOVE the allows for Office 365, Adobe CC, etc...  but then it's like it hits on that restrictive policy and does not care to move down to the next line and evaluate that hey.... they are allowed to use O365 resources or Adobe CC. I appreciate the help!",0,"

I already pre-configured Aggregate interface group with some interfaces inside. So I will create subinterface with Vlan, Zone, IPv4 and commit. 4. I will try ping next hop for the interface/subnet I created.Now, here starts where I am not sure:5. Next based on if 'Suspend local device' was used, I will either click 'Make local device functional' or if member was whole time active under cluster, I will switch to active member and initiate the failover. My question is, based on my plan, will the failover succeed? 6. Move configure the interface on old active, now passive member. Forgot to add that I will also change the static routes via CLI so they point to new interface:set network virtual-router default routing-table ip static-route ""Route_1"" interface ae1.300And before committing the new interface configuration, I will delete the old interface configuration and old static routes.After commit I will connect to CLI and paste static routes again with changed interface name/type.

Physical topology is full-mesh (each firewall connected to each switch)In normal situation two switches and firewall formed a L2-triangle, and secondary root switch blocked interface faced to firewall.Connection worked fine, until we reboot one switch (STP primary root).After rebooting switch, services was not interrtupted yet. Earlier mentioned port on secondary root switch transited to forwarding state, firewall learnt mac-addresses via one remaining L2-interface (i.e. Eth2), at this step network still works fine.After STP primary root switch loaded, it became the STP-root again, L2 triangle formed, and porton the secondary root switch faced to Eth2 transited to blocked state, but firewall did not knew this and continued to forward packets via Eth2 interface by MAC-entries learnt while first switch was down. This situation caused service interruption that was addressed by manual clearing arp-table on firewall, after that firewall learned new entries via interface faced to STP primary root switch.Is there any validated configuration example to achive reliable connection in this environment.Some vendors has ""Redundant Interface"" functionality to achieve this, but we can't find any similar solutions on Palo-Alto firewalls.We use VRRP and static routing to keep configuration simple.",0,"

60,315840,Best Practice Assessment Discussions,SutareMayur,Cyber Elite,TCP Half Closed Connection and Palo Alto Firewall,"TCP Half-Close Session - TCP is a unicast connection-oriented protocol. Before either end can send data to the other, a connection must be established between them. During connection establishment, several options can be exchanged between the two endpoints regarding the parameters of the connection.  Some options are allowed to be sent only when the connection is established, and others can be sent later.A connection typically goes through three phases:Some of the difficulty in creating a TCP session is handling all of the transitions between and among these phases correctly.A typical TCP connection establishment and close (without any data transfer) is shown below:   The figure above also shows how a TCP connection is closed (also called cleared or terminated). Either end can initiate a close operation, and simultaneous closes are also supported. Traditionally, it was most common for the client to initiate a close. However, other servers (e.g., Web servers) initiate a close after they have completed a request. Usually a close operation starts with an application indicating its desire to terminate its connection (e.g., using the close () system call). The closing TCP initiates the close operation by sending a FIN segment (a TCP segment with the FIN bit field set). The complete close operation occurs after both sides have completed the close: The rule is that either end can send a FIN when it is done sending data. When a TCP receives a FIN, it must notify the application that the other end has terminated that direction of data flow. The sending of a FIN is normally the result of the application issuing a close operation, which typically causes both directions to close. TCP Half Close – TCP supports a half-close operation.The half-close operation in TCP closes only a single direction of the data flow. Two half-close operations together close the entire connection.TCP Half-Close connections are when a server or client sends a FIN when it is done sending data, but the other side is not finished sending data. Due to this condition, the other side continues to send data.This is because TCP allows you to close each direction of the connection independently.  Below figure shows TCP Half Closed Stage.  HOW DOES A PALO ALTO FIREWALL  HANDLE TCP HALF-CLOSE CONNECTIONS? In this scenario, when the Palo Alto firewall sees the FIN from either side, the session goes to TCP-WAIT mode which resets the session time-to-live to 30 seconds. The session will remain in the ACTIVE state for 30 seconds and the session is closed afterwards. Thus, further data sent by the other side after these last 30 seconds will be discarded causing applications to fail. If applications handled in this manner are causing the sessions to fail, the tcp-wait timer can be increased: From Web UI - Go to Device > Setup > SessionEdit the Session Timeouts sectionEdit the value for ""TCP wait"" From CLI - # set deviceconfig setting session timeout-tcpwait <time-in-seconds> It is recommended to be cautious with this setting as it may cause an increase in the use of the session table, as more sessions may remain open and consume session table entries. Hope you find this helpful! Mayur",0,"

But I've confused myself. IPSEC is a layer 3 protocol and SSL operates at layers 5 and 6. As a “fall back” protocol for GP – is that in case if there are problems with establishing the tunnel through the end user’s ISP (as one comment indicated) or is it in case of authentication problems due to  latency and degradation of the tunnel as it passes from inside to outside. I can see the L3 IPSEC tunnel being best for outside endpoint connections. And as far as SSL, since it works more at an application layer, using it for navigating the internal network, such as file shares and applications that aren’t web-based. (Can there be a mid-transmission switch like that?)  So, in essence running both protocols being dependent on type of data access. But wouldn’t that kind of transition cause latency against wire speed transmissions? I just don’t understand the “fall back” aspect. Are we expecting that in some circumstances IPSEC will fail?",2,"
