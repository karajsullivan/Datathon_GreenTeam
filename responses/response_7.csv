0,492782,Astardzhiev,"Hi @dmoore-acc360- Export named config snapshot, will allow you to export saved configurations including candidate and running config. For example let say you are planning big firewall change and you want to have backup if you need to revert. You can save the running config and give it distigusable name (ex. ""before-big-mess.xml""). Named config snapshot will allow you to export this config backup by specifing the name. Similarily you can export the current running or candidate config.- Export configuration version will allow you to export one of the revisions that are automatically saved during commit. As the name suggest they don't have distigusable name, but rather a number - configurable number of revisions are stored, after that the oldest is deleted to free space for the latest.- Export device state - in addition the running config other firewall state information files are added and exported as bundle. This include Panorama pushed templates and device group (if firewall is managed by panorama), and GlobalProtect information related to the LSVPN. This option is useful when replacing the firewall and wants to restore to the latest device state.",0,07-07-2022,06:33 AM

20,487235,LCMember4427,"I ask because the former time we needed to migrate the same VM-100 from a really old host I had requested our Palo support provider for help since we couldn't accept more than some minutes of downtime.They disabled our current license in the PAN portal as per the book before closing down the 'old' VM-100. However when starting the cloned copy on the new host it refused to access the internet without a license because 'the allowed number of security zones was exceeded'. And with no internet access they had no access to our license portal where our current license was waiting to be activated. As we have 10+ security zones in our config, the 'normal' way of painless migration was not possible. After having struggled for hours the support team finally wiped out our config and started from scratch with two zones and from that imported our 10+ zones setup... But we were offline for 4 hours before they got everything up and running again....I understand PAN's concern about not letting users run their products without a license but I think that only disabling the LOCAL zones while leaving the untrust/internet zone enabled would have provided sufficient protection against 'fraud'. In that case we will always have an open path to the portal so any valid license could be (re)assigned in the PAN license portal to ensure painless migration or hardware upgrades...In any case it's in my opinion a really bad idea to deny access to the portal you badly need in order to activate your own licenses....",0,05-15-2022,12:27 AM
21,473050,upelister,"1) What determines when traffic gets sent to the second gateway instead of the on-board gateway?-Based on your config on portal.-If you choose auto gateway selection with same weight it uses ssl response time. You can see it on PANGPS log and PANGPA logs.2) Can the same certificate be used for both gateways? I use certificate based authentication. The server certificate on the existing firewall is gp.acme.com - would this same certificate go onto the new gateway as well? I ask as the two gateways would have different IP addresses.-For gateway config if you have wildcard certificate which is not recommended but somehow it works you can use.-If you have a wildcard certificate which has your two gateway FQDN address as subject alt name it works and recommended you can use.Else, (An idea, I did not try.)İf you create two DNS record for your VPN gateways and portals example;DNS Record1 vpn.acme.com = 1.2.3.4DNS Record2 vpn.acme.com = 1.2.3.5Same certificate should be usable. User will connect which response (faster one) they get.You mentioned ""I use certificate based authentication. ""İt is a authentication mechanism which is not related gatway and portal certificate config. You can use same Autjentication Certificate profile for other gateways.3) If the virtual PAN/secondary gateway was on the inside of DMZ interface of the hardware PAN, would it be still able to serve as the secondary gateway?İf its behind NAT (Not reccomended because NAT means you are making packets more small so SSL connections may be fail.) After Creating requered rule on Hardware PAN should work.Another Option create sub interfaces on Hardware PAN and serve more than one Portal and Gateway on same firewall (I am running 8 Portal and different gateway on same Hardware PAN).I suggest before taking action Create a test gateway and portal then see results.Have a nice day.",0,03-15-2022,01:22 PM

24,463629,Basavaraj,"Hi EminetX,VMware workstation and Palo alto interfaces are different, when you install Palo alto you get set up of interfaces in the Palo alto VM and in the VMware workstation you can configure whatever the virtual network adapters you need. once you decide how many interfaces you needed on the firewall, those many virtual adapters you need to configure inside the VMware workstation, logically those interfaces whatever you configure on the VMware workstation they get attached to Palo alto interfaces.for the lab, you can configure 2 or 3 interfaces and practice.don't get confused with the number of interfaces on the VMware workstation and Palo alto VM.there are so many youtube videos available if you search you will get plenty, you can watch and practiceRegardsBasavaraj",0,02-06-2022,02:17 AM

29,451136,avelK,"Thank you for posting question@PZemtsovBy cluster do you mean active/standby or active/active failover pair? If yes, then there is no impact/disruption while building failover pair. There could still be an outage in the case of misconfiguration or mis-operation. For example if there is an failover to the other VM where interface mapping is misconfigured.After you complete the HA configuration, I would recommend to make a failover test that would just in case tolerate downtime.If you mean clustering function introduced in PAN-OS 10, then lowest spec VM supporting this feature is VM-300.Kind RegardsPavel",1,12-02-2021,09:29 PM
30,203793,thakala,"Hello,Each ESXi host requires a licensed firewall so if you have 50 ESXi host you need 50 VM-Series licenses. VM-Series pricing is same for non-NSX and NSX integrated solutions, so you need to purchase perpetual licenses which are all paid up front with support and security update subscritions for specific time frame (1 or 3 years etc).Unfortunaltely PANW does not have rental license model for Service Providers like VMware (VCPP) and Microsoft (SPLA) have. However, 50 licenses would be rather big deal so there might be some good discounts or other options for such deal.As I understand Panorama capabilities, there is no such multitenancy support currently which would allow you to specificy user roles so that they could see and manage rules matching only specific zone. So I think answer to your last question is no.",1,03-08-2018,10:01 PM
