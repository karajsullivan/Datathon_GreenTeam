2,410669,SaaS Security Discussions,CC538,L1 Bithead,Integrated CASB Makes Deployment Easy and Security Consistent,"On May 19th, Palo Alto Networks announced a new cloud security offering, SaaS Security, the only integrated cloud access security broker (CASB) that keeps pace with the SaaS explosion. SaaS Security is a comprehensive solution that comprises two subscription services: SaaS Security Inline and SaaS Security API (formerly known as Prisma SaaS). Alongside our new Enterprise Data Loss Prevention, this solution provides full multimode CASB capabilities to see and secure SaaS applications used across the organization, protect sensitive data, and prevent zero day threats at the lowest TCO. SaaS Security API connects directly to sanctioned SaaS applications, using an out-of-band, API-based approach. It protects SaaS applications consistently by applying Enterprise DLP, ML-powered threat prevention, and providing ongoing monitoring of anomalous or malicious user activity and administrative configurations. Adaptive access control lets you granularly manage access to SaaS applications, as well as define acceptable use policy. This deployment mode works across any access point—regardless of the user’s location or device—and preserves the user experience with standard business processes. These capabilities help accurately protect all sensitive data stored in cloud applications, maintain compliance with regulations such as PCI DSS and GDPR, and stop all unknown and known threats in real time, without requiring third-party security tools. SaaS Security Inline automatically discovers and controls new applications in-use to minimize emerging shadow IT risks. Natively integrated with Palo Alto Networks firewall platforms (Prisma Access, PA-Series and VM-Series), it is easy to deploy and offers the lowest TCO compared to traditional CASB products because it eliminates legacy CASB requirements to deploy a proxy-based solution for inline security. Enterprise DLP cloud service is natively integrated across SaaS Security, Prisma Access, VM-Series, PA-Series and Prisma Cloud. It is the industry’s first cloud-delivered enterprise DLP solution that comprehensively protects sensitive data across all networks, clouds and users. It easily enables data protection and compliance in minutes, eliminating deployment and ongoing management cycles to ensure the most cost effective enterprise DLP on the market. For more information about SaaS Security, click here: https://www.paloaltonetworks.com/network-security/saas-security.",0,"
