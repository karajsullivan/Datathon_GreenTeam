The underlying cause is application functionality using predictable URL/form actions in a repeatable way. The nature of the attack is that CSRF exploits the trust that a web site has for a user. By contrast, cross-site scripting (XSS) exploits the trust that a user has for a web site. Like XSS, CSRF attacks are not necessarily cross-site, but they can be. Cross-site request forgery is also known as CSRF, XSRF, one-click attack, session riding, confused deputy, and sea surf. 2) Missing secure Flag Attributes in the Encrypted Session (SSL) Cookie:-The Session Cookie Does Not Have ""Secure"" Attribute.The Secure Attribute Tells The Browser To Only Use This Cookie Via Secure/Encrypted Connections. This measure makes certain client-side attacks, such as cross-site scripting, slightly harder to exploit by preventing them from trivially capturing the cookie's value via an injected script.3) Referrer-Policy Header is not implemented:-It was observed that, Referrer-policy is not implemented in response header.Referrer-Policy is a security header designed to prevent cross-domain referrer leakage.Also, VAPT team has provided following links for 3 vulnerabilities1) http://projects.webappsec.org/Cross-Site-Request-Forgeryhttp://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/352.html 2) https://www.paladion.net/blogs/cookie-attributes-and-their-importancehttps://www.maravis.com/protecting-web-application-cookies-by-restricting-scope/ 3) https://scotthelme.co.uk/a-new-security-header-referrer-policy/",0,"

We are in the process of picking a tool to scan the docker images in the AWS code pipeline. While we were scanning using the default ECR scan process we noticed CVE-2021-33574, CVE-2019-25013, CVE-2021-3520. These are related to C libraries which we have nothing to do with.So we need to pick tools like Twistlock to guide us. Even though we know the severity levels we just don't understand what these 3 vulnerabilities are about. Generally they seem to be about DOS attacks but we want a more friendly set of messages and proper guidance. We also don't know what will fix these as it is a default OS layer that AWS provides. Will Twistlock  help ? Which technical paper or site gives us a set of usage instructions ?  Thanks.",0,"

I'm trying to determine whether any of these are false positives, and if they should remain blocked. The threat names all follow the same format: Virus/Win32.WGeneric.######, with the last 6 digits varying for each threat. When I check the threat vault, there is no further information provided as to the nature of the threat, other than a list of hashes associated with it. I've entered these hashes into VirusTotal.com and also AlienVault to see if any record of these as a malicious activity exists, but I've been unable to find any matches for the 30 or so hashes I've checked so far. Does anyone know what these hashes actually are? Are they the hash of the file being transferred, or the type of threat itself? We've gone to the source device where the threat was generated and there is no record of the hash that the threat corresponds to in Palo's Threat Vault. ",0,"

59,367178,Threat & Vulnerability Discussions,campo,L1 Bithead,"Pros & Cons to Blocking Java Files, and Which Ones to Block","Hey guys, I've inherited a ruleset that is blocking Java CLASS file downloads, but not Java JAR files. I am not a Java developer and have very limited knowledge of the particulars relating to these files as potential threat vectors. But I have seen nothing in my initial research that leads me to believe this was an intentional, justified policy. I can't see any reason why CLASS files would represent a larger concern than JAR files, and the rational thing to do would be either 1) unblock CLASS files as well (and rely on client-side mitigations for protection), or 2) block JAR files as well (if anything JAR seems like a greater threat, due to its ability to contain other malicious payloads).  I'm curious on the thoughts others might have on this. Is there a good reason to CLASS files exclusively? Is there a good reason to not block JAR files? Is blocking Java file downloads outright worth the added overhead to maintain such a policy? As far as this particular environment goes, it looks like the scope of CLASS file download attempts are pretty minimal in any case. With threat prevention scanning and other mitigations in place, I don't feel the risk here is that large. But if the risk is large enough to warrant continuing to block them, it would make sense to me that I should also be blocking the JAR files.",0,"

The problem is that our on-premise spam filter tries to do lookups against the sending domain when we receive email, and I believe that the lookups for the MX records and maybe TXT records, etc. My anti-Spyware policy is set to sinkhole newly registered domains. We found that all DNS lookups against the sending domain were returning zero results. Kind of like the action is block instead of sinkhole. The result is that my span filter was really slowing down waiting for DNS results that wouldn't ever arrive. This was slowing down normal mail delivery by hours. Obviously I don't want to disable DNS Security completely. I am also having problems sending email to some domains that are showing as parked, etc. We have put those domains in as exceptions. Is there a way to minimize impact of DNS Security on mail operations? I have a ticket open with support, and they're saying that the service is working properly (I never said it wasn't). This is a bit more of a design type question. For example, can I allow TXT and MX record lookups while sinkhole for other A records? The only other think I can think of is to set my spam filter to use different DNS servers, and to set the DNS Security policy for that specific DNS traffic to alert only.",0,"

The reason I'm asking is that whenever the Palo Alto blocks an attack from an IP address (Session End Reason is ""threat""), if we go in the ""Traffic"" view, we can see that not all the communications with that offending IP were terminated with a ""threat"" reason. Some of them are terminated by ""tcp-rst-from-client"" or ""tcp-rst-both"". In that case, I'm wondering if part of the attack (or payload) could have gone through to the destination IP before the Palo Alto stopped it. Are these connections expected and there should be nothing to worry about, or should we still investigate? Thank you.",0,"

What other pieces of evidence should I have linked with my request to put more weight into it? Are VirusTotal reports, threat intel from other sources (IBM X-Force Exchange, AlienVault, etc.) not enough? Do you need an actual malicious sample (SHA-256, MD5 hash, etc.) or else? Has anyone else been in the same situation as me? Thank you.",0,"

Then several hours later plus or minus a few hours (seems random), another scan interval occurs, but with a different source IP (and likely different region), and attacking a different destination IP from the last time it occurred.  Then it repeats. Our action for these attacks is ""reset-both"".  Should we be doing some thing different? We find it strange that this is coming from several regions around the world.  Are they all part of the same hacking group? Has anyone else also seen this same pattern?",0,"
