From what I gathered so far though, the use cases seem to be very niche if Im understanding correctly.  Much of Prisma Access advantages seems to be in gaining standard PA features/security while maintaining minimal Internet latency based on the users location.  Please help me if my assumptions/understanding below are incorrect and/or if there are some instances where I may not be considering. Cases where Prisma Access doesnt seem to be a fit Scenario1A customer with a single main site/DC and any number of remote users that all typically reside in close proximity (500 miles) of the main site/DC.  Remote users can vpn back into the main DC and maintain the same features provided by the main PAs at the main site.  I wouldnt think it would make sense to deploy Prisma Access in this situation because all users in this instance would have the standard features provided by the main site PAs and with most remote users being relatively close, there arent any latency gains. Scearnio2A customer with several main sites/DCs and several branch sites spread throughout a single country.  All sites are running PA firewalls for their WAN/Internet connectivity.  Again, with running PA products at all sites, PA standards should be able to be met.  Panorama should be able to maintain a standard for all configurations.  Assuming DCs arent extremely large distances between each other witinh the country, again, the latency you might gain by a local Prisma Access instance doesnt seem to really warrant its need. Possible Cases for Prisma AccessScenario1A multinational customer with offices spread throughout the world with DCs in only specific strategic locations.  Remote users and/or branches may be spread in far distances from the DCs.  In this case, I can see the value in Prisma Access as you dont want remote users in Japan for instance VPNing all the way back to the UK.  This Prisma Access could provide the same standard PA features/security whole not causing excessive delay from remote users say in Japan from having to remote all the way back to the UK.Scenario2A customer operating within a single country with main sites, branches and remote users spread throughout the country.  However, in this instance, they dont have PA firewalls at all these locations.  Thus without PA firewalls at all locations, PA standards/security cant be maintained.  Prisma Access would provide this set of standard access/policy.  My main possible objection here is that that the branches are still going to need some form of router/firewall at these branch locations.  So, yes theoretically, a company could go with a super low cost option for the local branches' router/firewall for internet and ipsec connectivity to Prisma, but would the cost of Prisma access for that branch basically be the cost to eventually to upgrade that branch with a small PA?  Also, overall in regards to the ""services"" vpn from prisma access to your main site for remote and branch access to resources at your main site, the concern there is the latency with essentially the ""double vpn"".  There is the vpn from the remote user/branch to Prisma Access and then the vpn from Prisma to your main site over the services connection.  To me this would add considerable delay as with any other double vpn solution? ",0,"

LDAP request from MU that can use infra subnet and both RN and SVC will have that route causing Asymetric routing issue. Is it a feasible solution to have SVC and RN on same node/site, if yes what all things are required. ",0,"

78,416487,Prisma Access Discussions,NikolayDimitrov,L3 Networker,Is it possible for Prisma Access to split the traffic between the on-premise globalprotect gateways and the prisma cloud based on app/domain/ip_addr?,When using Prisma access and on-premise devices can you do someting like per app_process/domain/destination_ip gateway selection (some traffic to be send to the geteways other to the prisma cloud)? What I mean by this is to do like a split-tunnel for the traffic but instead the excluded appications to be send directly to Internet to the prisma cloud (sounds like double VPN or if possible to send traffic to the Prisma cloud without VPN just for web filtering)?  My idea is for an office is easier to send the corporate traffic to the on-premise gateways as after they authenticate on the firewalls with their Microsoft Active Directory accounts and they will have corporate access to the internal environment but for a web traffic like facebook etc. it can go to the prisma cloud for web filtering without going to the on-premise gateways.    Edit:  I found out that in Prisma Access 2.0 Explicit Proxy is supported as an access method but can the two methods Globalprotect and Explicit Proxy  be combined ? First to establish a VPN for example to the on-premise firewalls and then to split the tunnel but the excluded traffic from the tunnel to not be send directly to internet but to the Prisma Cloud using the PAC file. Is this possible?,0,"

92,395527,Prisma Access Discussions,MikeC,L3 Networker,Prisma Access / On-Prem FW Scenarios,"I'm beginning to pursue Prisma Access and just wanted to make sure my understanding is correct.  Currently, my sites (HQ/DC/Branch) in various parts of the world have PA firewalls.  For GP, users connect to a PA FW in their region, all traffic is backhauled to that specific FW.  These offices range from as low as 10 people to a couple hundred users. The question around design is in a Prisma Access world, where are on-prem perimeter/edge firewalls truly needed.  More specifically, where is a FW needed with threat/url/wildfire licenses.  Some sites won't have a device capable of IPSec tunnel, so in those cases, sure fw will need to remain but licensing can be removed. My understanding is, a branch site will not need a firewall unless it has local resources that other sites will need to access. I believe this is the case since for service connections, as traffic exits Prisma, it is not inspected, so you'll need an on-prem firewall to do that inspection What about sites that have resources that are accessible to the internet?  My thought would be absolutely, but I've heard there is a way to have those internet accessible resources to be routed through Prisma Access?  This doesn't make sense to me, I don't see how this is possible.  Also, even if it was possible, it would run into the same as above. The traffic leaving Prisma Access to the service connection is not inspected.   So for this reason, I believe if you have resources exposed to the internet, local firewall must remain. My final question is about those offices accessing to the internet.  Is there a user limit where you'd want internet traffic to egress a local firewall to the internet, instead of sending it to Prisma Access?  For instance, if I have an office with 300,400 or 500 users, is there acceptable performance to send all their internet traffic to Prisma Access or is the on-prem FW a better solution here? Thanks!   ",0,"

In the case of multiple Service Connections existing, each GlobalProtect Gateway nodes will share the User-ID info with 1 of the Service Connection nodes, usually the closest node to it. For example I was working on a tenant with Service Connections in US-West and Us-Northwest. When I logged into a gateway based in US-Northwest, the US-Northwest Service connection received my user-id info, but the US-West Service Connection did not.This is important because if you're going to follow the above linked process, you will have to reference multiple/all service connections user agent IP addresses in order to get the info on all users coming in via GlobalProtect. I suggest using the following resources to identify if user <-> ip mappings have propagated to the local firewalls: https://knowledgebase.paloaltonetworks.com/KCSArticleDetail?id=kA10g000000Cm5bCAC https://knowledgebase.paloaltonetworks.com/KCSArticleDetail?id=kA10g000000ClR1CAK And as always, after you redistribute, make sure to enable User-ID on the zones on the on-prem firewalls.",0,"

96,393564,Prisma Access Discussions,KPawlak,L1 Bithead,Connecting Prisma Access to your Public Cloud,"Broadly speaking, there are a few ways to bridge Prisma Access (or a VM/physical firewall for that matter) into your public cloud environment. I will be using AWS as my example by very broadly these ideas still apply. AWS documents 4 ways to connection via VPN here. We're focused on the S2S use case, which as you can see they reference 2 options - the VGW (Virtual Gateway) and the TGW (Transit Gateway). VGWBroadly speaking again, the VGW is a per-VPC resource for connecting an individual VPC to a 'customer gateway' - which in this case would be Prisma Access. This is a straightforward option and we have public documentation on how to do it here. Please note that this documentation is assuming you're onboarding it as a 'Remote Network'. If your Prisma Access deployment is primarily centered around your users working from home / on the road, then you may not have a remote network license. Instead you would onboard this as a 'Service Connection' but the high level workflow is similar on the AWS side. Limitation of this option: the VGW does not do segmentation within the VPC at L7. You can use Security Groups in AWS to create IP based ACLs for access to certain resources in your VPC, however you will not be able to write a policy to allow a specific user group to have access to a certain EC2 instance using a specific application, so truly achieving a Zero Trust architecture is going to be a challenge.  You could potentially shore that up by also installing VM-Series firewalls inside this VPC and directing inbound traffic there but that is an extra step. The other *MAJOR* limitation of this approach is that as of the time of my writing this (March 2021), a VGW drops all traffic destined for an IP not in the VPC it is attached to. So if you have 2+ VPCs, you will need 2+ service connections with this deployment model. TGW: The Transit Gateway is a much more scalable approach and is frequently pointed to in our reference architecture guides for AWS. It does take more work to set up but can be a phenomenal tool for linking many VPCs and is also a recommended tool for enabling E-W traffic monitoring and segmentation using the Gateway Load Balancer VM-Series Integration.  This is much more recommended, does not have the routing limitation I referenced for the VGW above, and can help you insert other use cases moving forward. For organizations that can do so, we recommend going with a TGW based architecture for multiple use cases. VM-series: The last option is to directly insert VM-Series firewalls into your VPC and terminate the IPSec tunnel to that/those EC2 instances. This gives you the security benefits and removes the routing / dropping traffic to other VPCs issues of the VGW architecture, but is a bit less effort to set up than the TGW architecture. This is often a good starting point for organizations that will look to deploy the TGW architecture, but are not there yet and want to get the ball rolling on their Prisma Access deployment.  ",1,"

97,393553,Prisma Access Discussions,KPawlak,L1 Bithead,Allowlisting your Prisma Access Tenant,"Hi all, I've found that this is a frequent question that comes up for new and existing Prisma Access customers. Long story short there are a couple of ways to go about this. The most advanced and scalable option would be to use a solution like Cortex XSOAR  to automate things. For example, if you were to deploy a new Mobile User location, Cortex XSOAR can help you allowlist new egress IPs from your tenant, as is discussed here . There are many other use cases, such as automatically updating your SAML provider to expect authentication requests from this new gateway, and more. I cannot recommend enough going down this path if you can. However, for customers just getting started or who don't have the budget for such tools, you can take some other approaches leveraging the API and automation options of Prisma Access. Full Documentation for understanding the Prisma Access API is available here: https://docs.paloaltonetworks.com/prisma/prisma-access/prisma-access-panorama-admin/prisma-access-ov... However in short form, you may choose to either allowlist the hostnames of the gateways we orchestrate and deploy for you through your tenant, or you may allowlist the IP addresses.  The hostnames are immutable unless you choose to turn on/off a node location, whereas the IPs can change and grow to accommodate failover events for maintenance or scale out activities. To get the hostnames to whitelist, you may use the UI: For Panorama managed please go to Panorama > Cloud Services plugin > Status > Network Details > Mobile Users - GlobalProtect Here you will find the portal address as well as the gateway addresses of your tenant For Cloud managed, please open the Prisma Access App and go to  Manage > Mobile Users > GlobalProtect Setup > Infrastructure, and click the gear icon in the ‘Infrastructure Settings’ Box You portal hostname should be readily available near the top of the page, and the list of gateway FQDNs should be near the bottom if you scroll down If you need to allowlist IPs specifically, please feel free to leverage and customize this script to query the API. This was field created just to save time and is not a TAC supported tool so if API changes have been made since its last update let your SE know, but TAC will not be able to help you and there is no SLA to update it: https://github.com/chairforce2/Prisma-PAN-OS-API-Queries/blob/main/prisma-access-get-IPs.sh You will need your API key to do so. You can follow step 1 here to do this for a Panorama managed Prisma Access tenant, and follow step 1 here instead for Cloud Managed Prisma Access.",3,"

The IP addresses in this subnet also enable Prisma Access to determine the service routes for services such as LDAP, DNS, or SCEP, as well as enable other inter-service communication.

But you can configure minimum password complexity options for Local DB users in Prisma access with a workaround.   You can enable this feature for Local users by using another template.   Panorama -> Templates This has to be done through Panorama Cloud Service Plugin.  Panorama -> Cloud Services -> Configuration-> Mobile Users -> Settings -> Template Stack  Note: Password complexity features do not apply to users created in Mobile_User_Template or Mobile_User_Template_Stack. Users must be created in the new template. Also you may still not see the minimum password complexity options under template stack but will work with above steps.  ,0,"

116,,Prisma Access Discussions,kiwi,Community Team Member,Coming Soon: Prisma Access 1.7," Prisma Access 1.7 offers you some new and exciting features that will be released with the Cloud Services Plugin version 1.7. The Prisma Access 1.7 plugin is tentatively scheduled to be released near August 24th, so we want to make sure that you have the proper time to plan  and schedule this required plugin upgrade on your Panorama. Be sure to review the upcoming planned timelines, keynotes, and best practices references below. Prisma Access customers can also get a sneak peak at what's to come by going to the Customer Resources area on LIVEcommunity. Please see the following timeline to plan your upgrade: You must upgrade to the Cloud Services Plugin 1.7, which requires Panorama version 9.0.4 or later. The phased rollout for the Cloud Services plugin 1.7 is planned starting September 8, 2020. When the new plugin is available for you, you will receive a notification on the Customer Support Portal and an alert will be generated on Prisma Access Insights. After you receive the notification to install the plugin, you have until October 1, 2020 to complete the installation.  Update - The enforcement date for upgrading the 1.7 plugin has been moved to October 15th, 2020. Prisma Access customers must upgrade the current plugin to the latest 1.7 plugin by this date.  For more details about Panorama, be sure to sign in with your customer account and read, ""Prisma Access: Plan for Panorama EoS Dates for Panorama Software Versions"" in our Customer Resources area. After the service upgrades, the egress IP addresses may change from the currently used IPs to the reserved IP addresses. We recommend that the customers add all Active (in-use) and reserved public IPs to the allow list with SaaS/third-party vendors, so these IPs can be obtained by using the API.  For the Technical Documentation, please review, ""Retrieve the IP Addresses for Prisma Access"" in our TechDocs website. It is recommended to have the allow-list process automated. Verify you have the all Active and Reserved IPs on your allow list by August 20, 2020 and perform the verification of IPs on your allow list even after the upgrade on August 23, 2020. We would like to make you aware of some changes that will occur after upgrading to 1.7, specifically to the GP logs: The recommendation is to upgrade to 9.1.   9.0 EOL on 11/20 To receive notifications on service upgrade and availability, please subscribe here.  Thanks for taking time to read this blog.Don't forget to hit that Like (thumbs up) button and don't forget to subscribe to the LIVEcommunity Blog. Stay Secure,Kiwi out!",6,"
