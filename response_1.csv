      IP Drop - Spoofing - Internal Zones Only?

A Shared object is visible on ALL firewalls.Or you can create this object in a Parent Device Group and it will filter down to all child device groups and firewalls.If you are referring to SSL decryption exclusion - then add them under a template in 'Device'->'Certificate Management'->'SSL Decryption Exclusion' and again place a check mark on 'shared' so all firewalls will receive these.Note that you need the firewalls to be Panorama managed for above to work.Hope this helps,Shai",0,11-11-2021,07:06 AM

In the past, when I was working with Lab environment, I have reached my PAN contact to get short term temporary license to complete my verification.3. Panorama has to be licensed regardless of the version. The license is bound to S/N and not IP address. The license itself is called Device Management License and has the number of managed Firewalls you can have.For example if you are deploying M-600, then with license:PAN-M-600-P-1K you can manage up to 1000 firewalls.For example if you are deploying VM version,then with license:PAN-PRA-1000you can manage up to 1000 firewalls.I believe that smallest license you can have is for 25 Firewalls. Please note that dedicated log collector has to be licensed as well.I hope this answers your questions.Kind RegardsPavel",0,09-08-2021,09:07 PM

Having the single list items from a troubleshooting/debug perspective makes your life easier. Also from a reporting perspective, if I needed to see all traffic touching a particular rule, having it more granular allows for more focused, quicker investigations.Using options 1 or 2 in the above case means I won't be able to find out which devices are touching which rules. If I lump EDLs or regions together, I just see the rule is hit.If your network team comes to you with a ticket of some servers having stability and reachability issues, if you have a really pervasive outbound rule, it could muddy the water some.

Yes, most of the time it would be from the block which is configured on the interface.Below NAT use cases given, you need to configure Destination static NAT. You need to have dedicated security policy and NAT for each public IP with specific ports. You can have common security policy for the public IPs which need to be allow on the same ports and the zones. But for NAT yes, there should be separate NAT-Policy for each translation.

My log stream is around 5Mb/s right now.The Palo Alto firewall isn't the only system logging to it, but it's one of just a few, and the others log a handful of entries per minute, so that 5Mb/s is almost entirely my firewall logs.This is also the reason that we aren't logging these to Splunk.

      PA - 3020 recommended version and how to upgrade from PAN - OS from 8.0.4
    ",BatD,"@ChiragPYou need to download 8.1.0 and ideally install it, before installing 8.1.x. You do not need to reboot after installing 8.1.0.Also make sure that you install the latest content updates before the installation.Also not that 8.1.8 has some issues and the current preffered realase is 8.1.9-h4.So really you process should be:",0,09-05-2019,01:17 AM

Please advise if you can.Thank you.",0,09-05-2019,04:13 PM

    ",ChiragP,"I have a spare PA 200 device which isrunning with OS version 8.0.6. I downloaded OS 8.1.6 and tried to install on it.I have received below error from the command line:""The required '8.1.0' base image must be loaded before this image can be loaded. You do not have to install or run the base image, only download it. Once the base is loaded, re-download your target image.""So, following the above description given by the device, I believe for PA 3020 applies the same - download the base version 8.1.0 but NOT INSTALL! Download the 8.1.9-h4 version and install.Any suggestions!!Thank you.",0,09-05-2019,07:29 PM

    ",BatD,"@ChiragPThe post you are looking for is from July. The current recommended version is 8.1.9-h4. It has also have fixes for major vulnerability in previous versions.You are right that it will work without installing 8.1.0, however the new best practice guidence is to install it first to avoid errors.The reason beeing is that both images will need to be extracted when installing and installation can fail on smaller appliences with limited disk space.",0,09-06-2019,12:25 AM

    ",BatD,"I think in theory there should not be, and the advise is always to upgrade to the lates content version. However in my experience, the new 4digit content failed to install on older PanOS, which are now out of support (e.g. 5.0. or 6.0.).It only worked when installing older content, however there is no official option to download older content versions.I think that 6.1.0 should be fine, because it went out of support after the 4 digit content release. Just make sure that you first install the latest 6.1.x bugfix. If you are stuck, you can open a support ticket and ask for older content version.",0,09-20-2019,12:31 AM

      Global Protect and IPSEC Crypto with SSL Fallback
    ",SteveCantwell,"Hello there!I have always understood that the failback functionality, is in case that IPSec cannot be established for whatever reason.Maybe port 4501 is being blocked upstream, or your GP user is at a customer/vendor location and they do not allow IPsec on port 4501 outbound through their environment. I am sure there could be other reasons why IPsec would fail.So, if IPSec is not available, the solution is engineered to use SSL.Thanks.",0,08-02-2019,08:14 AM
