0,479913,Autonomous DEM Discussions,NolanRumble,L0 Member,ADEM log file formatting,Hi All! I created a SublimeText log formatting file to help identify where problems might be occurring when looking through the ADEM log file. Hopefully this will help minimize the amount of time that's required to sift through log files and figure out what's going on. File is located here --> https://github.com/TheScriptGuy/SublimeText-ADEM-Logs. Let me know if there's something you want to have filtered on and I'll see what I can do. #ADEM #SublimeText #syntax #logformat,1,"

2,474592,Autonomous DEM Discussions,JoeKwok,L2 Linker,ADEM Application test Advanced Options,"I would like to know the setting detail on ADEM Application test Advanced Options.As I see there are ADVANCED NETWORK TEST OPTIONS with TCP-443 and ADVANCED WEB TEST OPTIONS with https as a default setting.What is the purpose of these setting? Any explanation document related to these options? For example,I would like to add a application test for non-SaaS application such as ms-rdp in internal network on ADEM.After input target IP and application (ms-rdp), should I change the ADVANCED NETWORK TEST OPTIONS to TCP-3389? Or I just keep it in default?  ",0,"
