2,431176,Cortex Xpanse Discussions,JNichols8,L2 Linker,We frequently see CVEs being announced and want to know if our network is vulnerable. How can Expander help?,"While Expander cannot confirm that your Internet-facing assets are vulnerable to any given CVE, it can provide an inventory of potentially vulnerable assets by impacted Service or, in some cases, the version of the Service.  When a CVE is announced, go to the ""Services"" tab and use the Service Type filter to filter for the impacted service. The resulting view will provide you a list of potentially-impacted assets, with version information in the details pages if available, that you can use to start your internal investigation and patching process, or to feed a vulnerability management product.  If the impacted service is not listed, please contact your Customer Success team.",0,"
